 
Findings: 
 
 
 
A 0.9cm right supradiaphragmatic LN 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
One enhanced nodular like lesion about 1.9 cm in LLS with isodense change at late phase, may be compatible with A-P shunting 
 
3cm early enhanced and washed out tumor over S8 liver 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands  
 
Mild splenomegaly   
 
No definite biliary dilatation  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
Small bilateral calyceal stones  
 
tiny stone in right distal ureter with mild right hydroneprhosis 
 
Disappearance of the left distal ureteral stone (5.1 mm)    
 
s/p enterostomy in LLQ with parastomal hernia 
 
Post-operative change of pelvis with mild pelvic fascia stranding, no interval change 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
 
* One enhanced liver lesion in LLS,no interval change ,may be A-P shunting. 
 
*  3cm viable tumor noted in the S8 liver.
