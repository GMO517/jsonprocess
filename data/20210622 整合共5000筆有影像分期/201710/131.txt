Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Progression of the S7 liver nodule up to 3.3cm with early enhancement and washout, mor favoring HCC, FNH less likely 
Patency of the portal veins 
Moderate splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Progression of the S7 liver nodule up to 3.3cm with early enhancement and washout, mor favoring HCC, FNH less likely 
(tentative tumor staging without pathology nor afp elevation)
