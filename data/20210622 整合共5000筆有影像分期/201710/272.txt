 
Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Huge heterogenous enhance tumor in S7-8-5 of liver(11.8X10.4X11.3cm), favor  
 
 HCC 
 
A 3.3cm cyst in S4 liver 
 
Diffuse thrombosis of bilateral intrahepatic PV branches, partial  
 
 thrombus in promxial MPV and splenic vein 
 
Favor bilateral AP shunting during arterial phase 
 
Prominent coronary vein with gastrorenal shunt 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Moderate amount of ascites 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis; ascites 
 
2.Huge heterogenous enhance tumor in S7-8-5 of liver(11.8X10.4X11.3cm), 
 
  favor HCC 
 
3.Diffuse thrombosis of bilateral intrahepatic PV branches, partial  
 
 thrombus in promxial MPV and splenic vein 
 
4.Favor bilateral AP shunting during arterial phase
