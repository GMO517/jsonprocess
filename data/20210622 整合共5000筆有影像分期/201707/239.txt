Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Atrophic change of S4 liver 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
A 6.7mm nodule in S5 liver with early enhance, and persist enhance 
 
 in late phase, due to small hemangioma or HCC? 
 
Another 1.94cm nodule in S6 liver, with early enhance and early 
 
 washout, favor HCC

Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly; splenorenal shunt 
 
2.S5 tiny enhance nodule(0.67cm), due to hemangioma or HCC? 
 
3.Favor S6 HCC(1.94cm) 
 
4.Suspect cervical mass with dilated uterine cavity, suggest GYN follow up.
