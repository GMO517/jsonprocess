Findings:  
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
A 8.7 mm fatty nodule over pancreatic tail, maybe due to lipoma. 
 
No definite focal mass in spleen.  
 
Three early enhancement and early washout nodules in S2 (3.9 cm), S6 (3.5 cm & 3.3 cm), favoring viable HCCs.  
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Ascites  
 
Splenomegaly  
 
Hypodense lesions (2.4 cm & 3.6 cm) in anterior abdominal wall, maybe due to epidermal cysts 
 
No definite hydronephrosis  
 
Multiple diverticula at A-colon 
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis and mild splenomegaly with ascites  
 
     * Viable HCCs in S2 (3.9 cm), S6 (3.5 cm & 3.3 cm) 
 
     * A 8.7 mm fatty nodule over pancreatic tail, maybe due to lipoma.
