Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Multiple slight hyperdense nodules without enhancement in both lobes 
 
 of liver, upto 1.7cm, suspect regenerative nor dysplastic nodules 
 
A 2X2X1.6cm nodule in S3 liver with early enhance and washout, favor HCC 
 
A 7mm cyst in S4 liver 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
Presence of gastric and esophageal varices 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
 
2.S3 enhance nodule(2cm), favor HCC 
 
3.Multiple slight hyperdense nodules without enhancement in both lobes 
 
 of liver, upto 1.7cm, suspect regenerative nor dysplastic nodule
