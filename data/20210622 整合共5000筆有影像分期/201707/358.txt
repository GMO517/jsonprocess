Findings:  
 
 
 
Focal plate atelectasis over RLL RML and left ligular lobe  
 
Multiple poorly defined nodular masses in bilobar liver (6-20 mm) with poor enhancement regional lymphadenopathy, favoring metastatic nodules. 
 
A 3.7x3.0 cm hypodense nodular mass in pancreatic tail with perifocal fat stranding , abutting to splenic flexure colon. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
No splenomegaly  
 
Bilateral renal cysts .  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
 
Patency of bilateral ureters. 
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.   
 
Enlarged prostate with calcifications.  
 
A 3.1 cm soft tissue lesion in right scrotum, nature to be determined .  
 
No definite bony destruction.  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Highly suspected pancreatic tail cancer with regional lymphadenopathy and multiple bilobar liver metastases. 
 
     * Abutting to splenic flexure colon, suspicious colon invasion? 
 
     * A 3.1 cm soft tissue lesion in right scrotum, nature to be determined .
