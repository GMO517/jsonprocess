Findings: 
 
 
 
Bil. pleural effusion with partial collapse of bil. lower lungs 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Ill-defined lobulated conglomerated mass(11.9cm) with poor enhancement noted in S5/6 liver, favoring HCCs. 
 
Multiple small daughter nodules noted in bil. lobes of liver. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Collapse of gallbladder  
 
Diffuse tumoral thrombus in bil. and main PVs.  
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Massive ascites. 
 
Foley in urinary bladder. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with massive ascites. 
 
* Favoring S5/6 infiltrative HCC(11.9cm) and multiple bilobar daughter nodules. 
 
* Diffuse tumoral thrombus in bil. and main PVs.
