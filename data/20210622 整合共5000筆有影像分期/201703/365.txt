Imaging  Findings: 
A 2mm tiny nodular opacity in LLL 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A 6mm cyst in S4 liver 
A 2.36cm mass in S7-8 liver with early enhance and early washout, favor HCC 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Bil. renal cysts, upto 2.9cm 
Small aortocaval LN(5.5mm) 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1.Liver cirrhosis 
2.S7-8 liver tumor(2.36cm) favor HCC 
3.A 2mm tiny nodular opacity in LLL, nature? suggest chest CT or close follow up
