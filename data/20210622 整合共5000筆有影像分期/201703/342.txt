Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
One hypodens eliver nodule about 3.5cm in S7 with peripheral persistent enahncement, more favor hemangioma 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
No splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis, tiny left renal stones noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
One heterogenous enhanced uterine nodular mass about 5.8cm may be myoma 
 
Focal polypoid sigmoid colon mass about 3.7cm with two pericolic LNs up to 1.0cm, favoring colon cancer 
 
IMP: 
 
S7 enhancing liver nodule (3.5cm) may be hemangioma 
 
Multiple gallstones 
 
Tiny left renal stones
