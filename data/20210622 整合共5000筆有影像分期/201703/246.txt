Findings: 
 
Consolidation and shrinkage over LLL lung 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Two early enhancing nodules in S4-8 about 1.8 and 2.0cm with mild early washout may be due to HCCs 
 
Another two persistent enhancing liver nodules in S4 (1.6cm) and S6 (2.6cm) may be hemangiomas 
 
One liver cyst in S1 about 2.9cm 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs
