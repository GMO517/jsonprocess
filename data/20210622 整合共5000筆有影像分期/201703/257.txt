Findings: 
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lungs.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
No definite space occupying lesion in the liver, spleen and pancreas except small S7 cyst(1.3 cm). 
A 2.8 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule noted in the S6-7 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
Gallstones in gallbladder (up to 0.9 cm) without definite GB wall-thickening. 
No splenomegaly 
Small caliber of intrahepatic right portal veins 
Patency of portal vein   
Recanalization of the umbilical vein 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
Left renal cyst (0.9 cm).  
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis with GB stones 
* A 2.8 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule noted in the S6-7 liver, favoring viable HCC.
