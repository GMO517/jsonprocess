Findings: 
 
Multiple small lung nodules over bil. lower lobes may be metastasis 
 
Two anterior pericardiac enhanced nodules (1.8 & 1.9cm) may be metastatic LNs 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
Multiple hypodense liver nodular masses in bil. lobes, the biggest about 6.1cm in LLS 
 
Patency of the right and main portal veins but thrombosis of LPV noted 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
Dilated left IHDs due to tumor invasion 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Multiple liver nodules in bil. lobes, the biggest up to 6cm with dilated left IHDs and LPV thrombosis, favor cholangioca 
 
Bil. lower lung nodules may be metastasis and ant. pericardiac LNs
