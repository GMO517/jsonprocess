Findings: 
 
   
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Splenomegaly   
 
Ill-defined poor enhancing mass-like lesion(7.9cm) noted in S7-8 liver, favoring infiltrative HCC. 
 
Diffuse tumoral thrombus in bil. and main PV, extended into splenomesenteric junction. 
 
Tiny dot-like calcifications in the spleen. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys. Bil. small renal cysts. 
 
Patency of bil. ureters. 
 
S/P IVC filter in place. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs. 
 
Enlargement of prostate gland. 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen. 
 
No significant change of the osteolytic and osteoblastic change of right iliac bone as compared with last images. 
 
   
 
Impression: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
* Favoring infilrative HCCs(7.9cm) over S7-8 liver. 
 
* Diffuse PV tumoral thrombus and extended into splenomesenteric junction. 
 
* Stationary condition of bony lesion in the right iliac bone
