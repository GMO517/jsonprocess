Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple liver cysts in both lobes, the biggest up to 2.8cm 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
Diffuse biliary tree dilatation may be with hilar infiltrated mass r/o hilar tumor 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
Numerous bil. renal cysts with derranged normal renal contour structures and small renal size, no evident hydronephrosis, favor polycystic kidneys 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Suspected infiltrated hilar tumor (4cm) with biliary dilatation 
Multiple liver and renal cysts, favor polycystic disease

-------------------Primary Tumor(T)-------------------------- 
 Tx    ○Primary tumor cannot be assessed 
 T0    ○No primary tumor 
Stage 0 
 Tis    ○Carcinoma in situ 
Stage I 
 T1    ○Tumor confined to the bile duct, with extension up to the muscle layer or fibrous tissue 
Stage II 
 T2a   ○Tumor invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue 
 T2b   ●Tumor invades adjacent hepatic parenchyma 
Stage IIIA 
 T3    ○Tumor invades unilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery 
Stage IVA (T4 N0-N1) 
 T4    ○Tumor invades main portal vein or its branches bilaterally; or the common hepatic artery; or the second-order biliary radicals bilaterally; or unilateral 
second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement 
-------------------Regional Lymph Nodes(N)----------------- 
 Nx    ○Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed 
 N0    ●No regional lymph nodes □ 
Stage IIIB (T1-3 N1 M0) 
 N1    ○One to three positive lymph nodes typically involving the hialr, cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, posterior pancreatoduodenal, and portal vein lymph nodes 
Stage IVB 
 N2    ○ Four or more positive lymph nodes from the sites described for N1  
-------------------Distant Metastasis(M)--------------------- 
 M0   ○No distant metastasis (no pathologic M0; use clinical M to complete stage group) 
Stage IVB 
 M1   ○Distant metastasis□
