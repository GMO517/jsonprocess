Findings:  
 
 
 
Dense pleural thickeing with calcification in bil lower chests due to fibrothorax.  
 
A 3.7 cm duodenal diverticulum. 
 
A 2.87 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in LLS liver, highly suspected viable HCC. 
 
A 0.89 cm strongly persistently enhancing nodule in S6 liver, favor hemangioma. 
 
Two small nodules with centripetal enhancement in S4 (1.0 cm) and S6-7 (1.1 cm) liver, maybe due to hemangiomas 
 
NNo definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
Calcification of prostate.  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
No definite hydronephrosis  
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
No definite bony destruction.  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * A 2.87 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in LLS liver, highly suspected viable HCC. 
 
     * A 0.89 cm strongly persistently enhancing nodule in S6 liver, favor hemangioma. 
 
     * Two small nodules with centripetal enhancement in S4 (1.0 cm) and S6-7 (1.1 cm) liver, maybe due to hemangiomas?
