Imaging findings:  
 
Infiltration at left lower lobe   
 
No obvious dilatation of the biliary tree and no stone in it  
 
No definite portal vein thrombosis  
 
Suspicious a tiny gallstone 
 
A hepatic cyst at the S4 about 1.0cm  
 
A 3.1cm heterogeneous enhanced mass in the S6 liver 
 
No hydronephrosis or hydroureter noted  
 
Several enlarged lymph nodes at the retroperitoneum, IMA, pelvis  
 
Irregular colon wall thickening at rectum, due to rectal ca? 
 
A 2.4cm in the right pararectal region, due to tumor deposit or enlarged LN? 
 
Enlargement of the prostate   
 
Multiple bilateral renal cysts

Impression:  
 
* Suspicious a tiny gallstone 
 
* A 3.1cm heterogeneous enhanced mass in the S6 liver, due to metastasis or HCC 
 
* Several enlarged lymph nodes at the retroperitoneum, IMA, pelvis, maybe due to metastasis 
 
* Consistent with rectal ca  
 
* A 2.4cm in the right pararectal region, due to tumor deposit or enlarged LN? 
 
* Enlargement of the prostate
