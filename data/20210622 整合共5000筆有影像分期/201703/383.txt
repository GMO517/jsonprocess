Imaging findings:  
 
Small lobulated contour of liver with splenomegaly, compatible with liver cirrhosis  
 
No obvious dilatation of the biliary tree and no stone in it  
 
No definite evidence of portal vein thrombosis  
 
A hepatic massat the S8 about 2.6cm with early enhancement and wash-out, suggestive of hepatocellular carcinomas 
 
A radiopaque stone in gallbladder without obvious wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid accumulation   
 
No delayed function of the both kidneys 
 
No obvious obstructive uropathy  
 
No definite enlarged lymph nodes noted at visualized fields  
 
No definite evidence of pneumoperitoneum or ascites noted  
 
No obvious bony destruction detected   
 
 
 
Impression: (1) liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly (2) a S8 liver tumor, maybe due to HCC
