Findings:  
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
A 1.6 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S8 liver, favor viable HCC . 
 
A small early enhanced wedge shaped area at S8 liver with isodensity in delay phase , more favoring focal A-P shunt . 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
 
No definite hydronephrosis  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. 
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
S/P transpedicle screw fixation of L spine . 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis with a 1.6 cm viable HCC in S8 liver . 
 
     * A small early enhanced wedge shaped area at S8 liver with isodensity in delay phase , more favoring focal A-P shunt .
