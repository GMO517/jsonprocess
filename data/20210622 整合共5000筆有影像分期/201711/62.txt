Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis  
 
Focal hypodense liver nodule in S7 about 1.6cm with early washout, favor HCC 
 
Another two tiny lesions in S4-8 (0.7cm0 and S7-8 (0.8cm) with hypodense change at late phase, can not exclude tiny tumors 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
Focal hypodense soft tissue mass about 3.5x4.5x6.5cm encasing the aorta r/o metastasis 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy   
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Three hypodense liver nodules in S7 (1.6cm), S4-8(0.7cm) & S7-8(0.8cm), r/o HCCs 
 
Focal hypodense mass about 3.5x4.5x6.5cm encasing the aorta r/o LN metastasis
