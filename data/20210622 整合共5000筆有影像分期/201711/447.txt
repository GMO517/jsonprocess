       Report: Brief Hx: Liver hypoechoic nodule (2.12cm, S6), with internal pulsatile flow, recurrent  
    HCC was considered 
 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 2013.05.31 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
s/p partial hepatectomy of S8 
 
A small hypodense liver nodule about 1.6cm in S6 with early enahncementn and early washout, favor HCC 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
s/p partial hepatectomy of S8 
 
New liver nodule in S6 with early ehnacing and washout, compatible with HCC
