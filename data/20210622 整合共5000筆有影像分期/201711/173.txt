-------------------Primary Tumor(T)-------------------------- 
 
 Tx  ○Primary tumor cannot be assessed  
 
 T0  ○No evidence of primary tumor  
 
Stage 0 
 
 Tis  ○Carcinoma in situ 
 
Stage I 
 
 T1  ●Tumor invades lamina propria or muscle layer 
 
    T1a   ○Tumor invades lamina propira  
 
    T1b   ○Tumor invades muscular layer 
 
Stage II 
 
 T2  ○Tumor invades perimuscular connective tissue; no extension beyond serosa or into liver 
 
Stage IIIA 
 
 T3  ○Tumor perforates the serosa (visceral peritoneum) and/or directly invades the liver and/or one other adjacent organ or structure, such as the stomach, duodenum, colon, pancreas, omentum, or extrahepatic bile ducts 
 
Stage IVA (T4 N0-1) 
 
 T4  ○Tumor invades main portal vein or hepatic artery or invades two or more extrahepatic organs or structures 
 
-------------------Regional Lymph Nodes(N)----------------- 
 
 Nx  ○Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed  
 
 N0  ●No regional lymph node metastasis 
 
Stage IIIB (T1-T3 N1 M0) 
 
 N1  Metastases to nodes along the cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, and/or portal vein. 
 
Stage IVB  
 
 N2  Metastases to periaortic, pericaval, superior mesentery artery and/or celiac artery lymph nodes 
 
-------------------Distant Metastasis(M)---------------------- 
 
 M0  ○No distant metastasis (no pathologic M0; use clinical M to complete stage group) 
 
Stage IVB 
 
 M1  ○Distant metastasis
