Findings:   
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in scanned field. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
One 5.5x3.4x3.9cm lobulated, exophytic mass in S6 of lvier showing early enhancement and early wash-out. Compatible with HCC. 
 
Multiple hepatic cysts in bilateral lobes of liver up to 0.86cm. 
 
Patency of portal vein. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
Splenomegaly. 
 
Two 1.6cm and 0.89cm accessory spleens. 
 
Normal function of bilateral kidneys without definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
Appendix is not dilated. 
 
Enlarged precaval lymph node (1.3cm). 
 
Multiple small but visible hepatic hilar, celiac, lesser curvature, and dorsal pancreas lymph nodes. 
 
No obvious ascites. 
 
No abnormal free air in the abdomen. 
 
 
 
* Please kindly note that CT is not designed and not optimal for diagnosis and evaulation of mucosal lesions of hollow organ. 
 
 
 
IMP:  
 
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
 
* Highly suspicious for HCC in S6 of liver with enlarged precaval lymph node. 
 
* Multiple small bilobar hepatic cysts.
