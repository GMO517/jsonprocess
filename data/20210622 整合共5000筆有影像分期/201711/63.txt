 
Imaging  Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous  
 
system compatible with fatty liver  . 
 
Multiple low attenuation lesions in both lobes of liver(〈1.7cm), 
 
favor cysts 
 
An encapsulated heterogenous enhance mass in S7 liver(5.4cm), 
 
early enhance and early washout, favor HCC 
 
Another faint enhance mass (2.8cm) in S4 of liver, persist  
 
enhance in late phase 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Bilateral small renal cysts 
 
Bilateral renal calyx stones(〈7mm) 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Mild dilatation of abdominal aorta(2.8cm) 
 
 
 
The volumetric of right and left lobe liver is 1245cm3 and 594cm3  
 
respectively 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1. Fatty change of liver. moderate to severe 
 
2. S7 liver mass(5.4cm), favor HCC 
 
3. S4 liver mass(2.8cm), suspect HCC 
 
4. Multiple liver and renal cysts 
 
5. Bilateral renal calyx stones
