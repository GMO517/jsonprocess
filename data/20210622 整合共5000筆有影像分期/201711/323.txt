Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Two hypodense liver nodules in S4 (2.8cm) and S8 (1.3cm) with early enhancement and washout, compatible with HCCs  
 
Another enahnced liver lesion in LLS about 1.5cm with persisted enhancement but seems become isodense at late phase, nature to be determined 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Moderate splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Two early enhanced liver nodules in S4 and S8, moire favor HCCs 
 
Another small one in LLS with persisted mild enahncement, nature to be determined
