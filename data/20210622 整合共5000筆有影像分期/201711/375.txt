Findings:  
 
 
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lungs and RML. 
 
A 6.7 mm pulmonary nodule in LLL, nature to be determined .  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
A 1.8 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S8 liver dome, favoring HCC. 
 
A 1.0 cm hypodense nodule in S1 liver without definite enhancement, maybe due to regenerative nodule 
 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
 
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the left with size of 4.1 cm .  
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
Left tiny renal stone, but no definite hydronephrosis  
 
Small but visible retroperitoneal LNs 
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
Focal sclerotic change over L2 spine, maybe due to bone island  
 
Calcification of prostate.  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
