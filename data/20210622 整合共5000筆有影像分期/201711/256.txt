Imaging findings:  
 
Consolidation at RLL lung field 
 
Atelectasis found in the RML  
 
A 19.2x13.7cm heterogeneous mass in the right lobe liver with right inferior portal vein invasion 
 
No definite portal vein thrombosis  
 
Mild right IHDs dilatation

Impression:  
 
* Consolidation at RLL lung field 
 
* A 19.2x13.7cm heterogeneous mass in the right lobe liver, maybe due to HCC
