       Report: Brief Hx: liver cirrhosis, S3 nodule r/o HCC 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Two early enhancing liver nodules in LLS about 2.2cm and S6 about 1.3cm with early washout, favor HCCs 
 
Another multiple tiny hypodense liver lesions (〈1.4cm) without evident enahncement may be regenerative nodules 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Moderate splenomegaly 
 
Mild ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
Large uterine mass about 5.6cm may be endometrial tumor, nature? 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
 
Two early enhancing liver nodules in LLS (2.2cm) and S6 (1.3cm) with early washout, favor HCCs 
 
AMultiple tiny hypodense liver lesions (〈1.4cm) without evident enahncement may be regenerative nodules
