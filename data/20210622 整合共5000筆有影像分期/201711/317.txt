Findings: 
 
 
 
Two pulmonary nodules(7.6mm and 5.1mm) noted in RLL. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Lobulated heterogenous mass(12.4x7.4cm) with poor enhancement noted in LLS. 
 
Thrombosis of left PV and LHV with extended into IVC. 
 
Another two hypodense lesions with poor enhancement noted in S4(2.2cm) and S7(4.6cm) liver. 
 
Miminal ascites. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis. 
 
* Favoring infiltative HCC(12.4x7.4cm) with left PV and LHV invasion and extended into IVC. 
 
* Another two hypodense lesions with poor enhancement in S4(2.2cm) and S7(4.6cm) liver, favoring daughter nodules. 
 
* Two pulmonary nodules(7.6mm and 5.1mm) noted in RLL, favoring metastasis. 
 
* Miminal ascites.
