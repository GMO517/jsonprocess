CT of liver without & with contrast enhancement triphasic scans shows:  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
Early enhanced and washed out tumor over the LLS (1.5cm) and S8 (1cm) 
0.72cm early enhanced but no washed out over S8 liver 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Splenomegaly   
Patency of the portal vein 
IMP:  
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
HCCs over the LLS (1.5cm) and S8 (1cm) 
0.72cm early enhanced but no washed out over S8 liver, suggest follow up
