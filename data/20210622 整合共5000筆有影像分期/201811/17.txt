Findings: 
Focal infiltration over RLL. 
Tiny pulmonary nodule in RLL (2.0mm). 
Focal thickening pleura with calcification over bil. basal chest. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Several hypodense, poor enhancing nodules in liver (S4/hilum:2.6cm, S8:1.9cm and 1.0cm) causing right IHDs dilatation. 
Otherwise, the S4 mass with left and right anterior portal vein invasion. 
Gallstone. 
Enlarged hepatic hilar lymph node (1.54cm).  
Diverticulum at D-colon. 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Bil. renal cysts. 
Enlarged prostate gland with calcifications. 
Mild wall thickening of urinary bladder. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection or free air in the abdomen  . 
No definite bone destruction. 
 
IMP: 
* Concerning cholangiocarcinomas or HCCs over right lobe liver with left/right anterior   portal vein invasion and hepatic hilar lymphadenopathy.  
* Tiny pulmonary nodule in RLL (2.0mm), nature need to be determined.
