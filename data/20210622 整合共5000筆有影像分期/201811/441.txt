Findings: 
Multiple tiny lung nodules in both lower lobes, the bigegst about 0.7cm 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Focal infiltrated hypodense liver nodule about 2.9cm in S8 with mild enhancement 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Focal ill-defined hypodense nodule over pancreas body about 2.3cm with peripancreatic stranding r/o malignancy 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
Multiple enlarged retroperitoneal LNs over periceliac, peripancreatic, pericaval and periaortic regions, the biggest up to 2.5cm, favor metastasis 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Suspected pancreatic cancer with lung, liver and retroepritoneal metastasis
