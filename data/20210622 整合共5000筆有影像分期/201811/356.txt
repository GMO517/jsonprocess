Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 2.3cm in LLS with early washout, favor HCC 
2 small early enhanced nodules over S8 (0.63cm) and S5-6 (0.79cm) of the liver 
Multiple small hypodense liver lesions without enhancement in both lobes may be regenerative nodules 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but tiny gallstone noted 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
HCC over LLS liver (2.3cm) 
2 small early enhanced nodules over S8 (0.63cm) and S5-6 (0.79cm) of the liver
