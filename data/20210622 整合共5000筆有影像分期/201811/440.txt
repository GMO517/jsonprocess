Findings:  
 
Diffuse atherosclerotic change of visualized vessels.  
Focal plate atelectasis over RML 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
A 2.5 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S6-7 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
A 1.0 cm hypodense lesion at pancreatic body, maybe due to cyst. 
Gallstones without definite wall-thickening of gallbladder.  
Patency of portal vein.  
Hypodense lesions in the spleen (up to 0.9 cm), maybe due to cysts. 
Diffuse atherosclerotic change of visualized vessels.  
Compression fracture of L1 spine S/P vertebroplasty  
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
Degenerative change of thoracic and lumbar spine with spurs formation and scoliosis.  
 
IMP:

* A 2.5 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S6-7 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
* Hypodense lesions in the spleen (up to 0.9 cm), maybe due to cysts. 
* A 1.0 cm hypodense lesion at pancreatic body, maybe due to cyst.
