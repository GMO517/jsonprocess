Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
A poorly defined  5.3 cm hypodense mass with early washout in S7-8 liver, suspected invasion or encasement of RHV. 
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
Two cardiophrenic enlarged LNs (20 mm & 9 mm), favoring metastatic LNs 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
Compression fracture of L4-5. 
Focal sclerotic change over right acetabulum (0.6 cm), maybe due to bone island  
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the right with size of 2.5 cm .  
Right lower calyceal stone with a 1.2 cm poorly defined hypodense nodule in lower renal pole, chronic inflammation associated with renal stone? 
No definite hydronephrosis  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
Enlarged prostate with calcifications.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP:  
* A poorly defined  5.3 cm hypodense mass with early washout in S7-8 liver, suspected invasion or encasement of RHV, compatible with HCC. 
* Two cardiophrenic enlarged LNs (20 mm & 9 mm), favoring metastatic LNs 
* Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the right with size of 2.5 cm .  
* Right lower calyceal stone with a 1.2 cm poorly defined hypodense nodule in lower renal pole, chronic inflammation associated with renal stone? 
* Compression fracture of L4-5.
