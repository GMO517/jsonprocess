Findings:   
No definite pulmonary nodule in visible lung field. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas.  
(however isodense lesion maybe obscured without enhancement) 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Lobulated contour of liver, compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
Splenomegaly with prominent varices. 
Suspicious S4 liver nodule 1.7 cm. 
A suspicous isodense to hypoechoic nodule 2.1 cm in S5/8 liver. 
Gallstone without apparent inflammatory change of GB  
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Bil. small kidneys. 
Hypodense nodule in left kidney upto 1.4 cm, maybe cyst.  
No apparent adrenal mass. 
Vascular lesion and lymph node are better shown by enhancement study. 
No abnormal free air in the abdomen.  
No apparent bone destruction. 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT. 
Minimal ascites in the pelvis. 
 
IMP: 
1. Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
2. Suspicious S4 liver nodule 1.7 cm. 
3. A suspicous isodense to hypoechoic nodule 2.1 cm in S5/8 liver.

Stage I 
T1   ● Solitary tumor ≦2 cm, or > 2cm without vascular invasion 
T1a  Solitary tumor ≦2 cm 
T1b  Solitary tumor > 2cm without vascular invasion 
Stage II 
T2   ○ Solitary tumor >2cm with vascular invasion, or multiple tumors,none >5cm  
Stage III 
T3   ○Multiple tumors more than 5 cm  
T4   ○TSingle tumor or multiple tumors of any size involving a major 
branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein, or tumor(s) with direct 
invasion of adjacent organs other than the gallbladder or with 
perforation of visceral peritoneum
