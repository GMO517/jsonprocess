Imaging  Findings: 
A mass measure about 2.46X1.64X1.96cm in S1 liver with early enhancement with a central nidus, and nearly isodensity in portal and late phase, suspect focal nodular hyperplasia 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
Patent PV 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Bilateral tiny renal stones; right renal cyst 
Left adrenal gland nodule(1X0.7cm) 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1.S1 enhance liver nodule(2.46cm), suspect focal nodular hyperplasia 
2.Bilateral tiny renal stones; right renal cyst 
3.Left adrenal gland nodule(1X0.7cm), suspect adenoma
