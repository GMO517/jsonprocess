Findings: 
 
Tiny lung nodules (2-3mm) in bil. lower lobes r/o metastasis 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
Large liver tumor (8x12x13cm) with early enhancement and washout in S4, favor HCC 
 
Obliteration of LHV and LPV may be due to mass effect and suspicious tumor invasion 
 
A daughter nodule about 2.1cm in S4b, another early enhanced lesion in S7 (2.1cm) but not seen at late phase r/o focal A-P shunting 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
Bil. renal cysts up to 3.4cm 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Tiny lung nodules (2-3mm) in bil. lower lobes r/o metastasis 
 
Large S4 HCC (8x12x13cm) with early enhancement and daughter nodule 
 
Obliteration of LHV and LPV due to mass effect and suspicious tumor invasion
