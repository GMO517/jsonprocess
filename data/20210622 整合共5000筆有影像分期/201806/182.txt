Findings: 
 
Pericardial effusion 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Splenomegaly. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the   spleen  
Ill define poor enhancing mass (4.2x3.6cm) in pancreatic tail region with splenic artery encsement. 
Obstruction abd obliterated of splenic vein , maybe be due to tumor invasion. 
Diffuse biliary dilatation  
Multiple poor enhancing mass in bil. liver, favor metastasis  
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
Patency of portal vein   
Bil. renal cysts.  
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Enlarged paraaortic and periportal LNs  
Ascites in pelvic cavity 
No  free air in the abdomen  . 
Wall thickening of urinary bladder. 
Enlarged prostate gland with internal calcification. 
No definite bone destruction. 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT. 
 
IMP: 
 
1.Ill define poor enhancing mass in pancreatic tail region with splenic artery encasement and possible splenic vein invasion. Pancreas cancer or metastatic LNs ? 
2.Enlarged retroperitoneal LNs, suspect lymphnode metastasis 
3.Poor enhancing mass in bil. liver, primary or metastasis? 
4.Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly. 
5.Diffuse biliary dilatation no interval change compared with 2015/7/31 CT study, pancreatic head/ampullar obstructive lesion?
