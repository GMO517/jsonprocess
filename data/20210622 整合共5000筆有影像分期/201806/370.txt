Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
A huge early enhancement and early washout mass (up to 16.9 cm) occupying right lobe of liver with extensive tumor thrombosis in RPV , LPV and MPV . 
Minimal ascites  
Small but visible periportal LNs, short axis < 1.5 cm. 
Several daughter nodules noted in right lobe of liver 
Occlusion of RPV with cavernous transformation 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Collapsed gallbladder. 
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Calcification of prostate.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis with minimal ascites
