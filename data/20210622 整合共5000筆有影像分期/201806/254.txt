Findings: 
 
Progression of S5 nodular mass (2cm〉〉3.6x4.3cm) with mild enhancement, compatible with malignant tumor 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Left adrenal gland hypodense nodule (2cm), no significant interval change, favor adenoma

No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
IMP: 
 
Progression of S5 nodular mass (2cm〉〉3.6x4.3cm) with mild enhancement, favor HCC 
 
Left adrenal hypodense nodule (2cm), no interval change, favor adenoma
