Findings:  
 
Focal plate atelectasis over RML 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
Two newfound early washout nodules without defnite enhancement in S4-8 (15.8 mm) and LLS liver (15 mm), suspicious viable HCCs? 
A stable 7.2 mm persistently enhancing nodule in LLS liver, favoring hemangioma. 
A 9.7 mm small fatty nodule in left kidney, favoring renal hamartoma. 
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
No definite obstructive uropathy.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
No definite bony destruction.  
A 1.5 cm fatty nodule at A-colon , due to lipoma? 
Multiple diverticula at A-colon  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
