Imaging  Findings: 
No obvious lung nodule 
Multiple hypodense tumors with mild peripheral enhancement in both lobes of liver, the biggest one about 13.8cm in S5-6 liver, favor metastasis tumors 
Favor infiltrative or ulcerative tumor of rectum may extends to left perirectal fat plane and with multiple enlarged regional LNs 
No significant peritoneal seeding tumor 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No adrenal gland mass 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Favor infiltrative or ulcerative tumor of rectum may extends to left perirectal fat plane and with multiple enlarged regional LNs 
2. Multiple liver tumors favor metastasis tumors
