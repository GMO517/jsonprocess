Findings: 
 
Mild coarse liver with fatty change due to chronic liver parenchymal disease 
 
A 3.1cm early enhanced nodular liver tumor in S5-6 with early washout, more favor HCC 
 
Patency of the portal veins but relative engorged branch of RPV beside the tumor could be due to portal branch invasion and small shunting 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
Volumetry of liver has right lobe size of 730cm3 and left lobe size of 455cm3 
 
IMP: 
 
Chronic liver parenchymal disease with fatty change  
 
Focal early enhanced liver tumor (3.1cm) in S5-6 with focal portal invasion, more favor HCC
