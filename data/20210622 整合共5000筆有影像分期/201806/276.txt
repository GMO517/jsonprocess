Imaging  Findings: 
Multiple nodules in bilateral lower lung, upto 7.2mm, favor lung metastasis 
Right pleural effusion 
A big heterogenous enhance tumor with central necrotic area in S4, part of S8 liver(14.3X11cm), another heterogenous enhance tumor(9.7X6.1cm) in S5 liver 
Four other solid tumors in S8(3cm), S7(1.76cm) and S5(1.25cm,1.58cm) of liver, with early enhance and early washout, favor HCCs 
A 2.1cm hypodense lesion or cyst in S8 liver 
S/P Partial gastrectomy, NH tube in place 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest one about 6.1cm in left kidney 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Minimal ascites around right perihepatic region 
 
Impression:  
1.Multiple enhance tumors in both lobes of liver, the biggest one about 14cm, more favor HCCs 
2.Multiple nodules in bilateral lower lung, upto 7.2mm, favor lung metastasis 
3.Right pleural effusion and minimal ascites 
4.S/P Partial gastrectomy
