Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Multiple cysts in liver, the biggest one about 1.7cm in S5 liver 
 
Two early enhance nodules in S6-7 (0.83cm,1.69cm) of liver 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Small right renal cyst 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.Multiple liver cysts 
 
3.Two early enhance nodules in S6-7 (0.83cm,1.69cm) of liver, favor HCCs
