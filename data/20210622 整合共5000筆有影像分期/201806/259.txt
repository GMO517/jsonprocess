Findings: 
Bil. pleural effusion 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple early enhanced liver nodules in both lobes with early washout, in LLS (1.6cm), S5 (1.1cm), S6 (1.4cm) and S7-8 (4.3cm) 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
Bil. small renal size, moderate left hydronephrosis due to distal ureteral obstruction, nature ? 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
Multiple early enhanced liver nodules in both lobes with early washout, in LLS (1.6cm), S5 (1.1cm), S6 (1.4cm) and S7-8 (4.3cm), favor HCCs 
ESRD with bil. small renal size and tiny stones, left hydronephrosis
