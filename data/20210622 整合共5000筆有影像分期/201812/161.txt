Imaging  Findings: 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
Several nodules and mass in S1(4.4cm,1.86cm), S5(2.16cm,9.3mm,7.9mm,1cm) liver with early enhance and early washout, favor HCCs 
Two early enhance nodules in S4(8mm) and S8(4.6mm) liver may due to HCC 
A faint hyperdense mass like lesion(3.8cm) in S5-6 liver without enhancement, nature? 
Two poor enhance nodules in S7-8(1.78cm) and S8(2.2cm) liver 
Two cysts in S5(1.1cm) and S1(1.5cm) liver 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  .Small left renal cyst(6.5mm) 
Calcification over uterus may due to myoma 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Liver cirrhosis 
2. Several nodules and mass in S1(4.4cm,1.86cm), S5(2.16cm,9.3mm,7.9mm,1cm) liver with   early enhance and early washout, favor HCCs 
3. Two early enhance nodules in S4(8mm) and S8(4.6mm) liver may due to HCC 
4. A faint hyperdense mass like lesion(3.8cm) in S5-6 liver without enhancement, nature? 
5. Two poor enhance nodules in S7-8(1.78cm) and S8(2.2cm) liver may due to regenerative   nodules
