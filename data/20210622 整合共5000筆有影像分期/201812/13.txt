Findings:  
 
Bilateral small pleural effusion with bil LL partial atelectasis 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Ascites  
Mild splenomegaly.

Extensive tumor thrombosis in RPV, LPV  
Multiple prominents LNs at the liver hilar, inter aortocaval and periportal regions, the biggest one of them at inter-aortocaval regio, 2.3x1.7 cm. 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
Bilateral renal cysts .  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
