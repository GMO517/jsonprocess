 
Findings: 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
 
Tortoustiy of aorta with wall calcification.    
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
 
Wedge-shape decrease attenuation of right lobe liver, favor fatty change with focal sparing of left lobe. 
 
An early enhanced and wash-out lesion at LLS (1.6 cm) causing distal portion of left intrahepatic duct mildly dilatation (5.3 mm), favor HCC. 
 
A hypodense, non-enhanced liver cyst (2.7cm) at S3.  
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder.  
 
Patency of portal vein.   
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas. 
 
An ill-defined, non-enhanced region in splenic parenchyma (7.3 mm), favor cyst.  
 
Accessory spleen (8.2 mm). 
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs. 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen.  
 
Degenerative change of lumbar spine with spurs formation.  
 
Small round laminated radiopaque density in the pelvic cavity due to phlebolith. 
 
A soft tissue nodule (1.3 cm) at subcutaneous fat of right flank region, nature need to be determine. 
 
Some subcutaneous calcifications at bil. lumbar regions.  
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with fatty change and sparing of left lobe. 
 
* A early enhanced and wash-out lesion at LLS (1.6 cm) causing distal portion of left   intrahepatic duct mildly dilatation (5.3 mm), favor HCC.
