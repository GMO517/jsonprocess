-------------------Primary Tumor(T)-------------------------- 
 Tx    ●Primary tumor cannot be assessed 
 T0    ○No primary tumor 
Stage 0 
 Tis    ○Carcinoma in situ 
Stage I 
 T1    ○Tumor confined to the bile duct, with extension up to the muscle layer or fibrous tissue 
Stage II 
 T2a   ○Tumor invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue 
 T2b   ○Tumor invades adjacent hepatic parenchyma 
Stage IIIA 
 T3    ○Tumor invades unilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery 
Stage IVA (T4 N0-N1) 
 T4    ○Tumor invades main portal vein or its branches bilaterally; or the common hepatic artery; or the second-order biliary radicals bilaterally; or unilateral 
second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement 
-------------------Regional Lymph Nodes(N)----------------- 
 Nx    ○Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed 
 N0    ○No regional lymph nodes □ 
Stage IIIB (T1-3 N1 M0) 
 N1    ●One to three positive lymph nodes typically involving the hialr, cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, posterior pancreatoduodenal, and portal vein lymph nodes 
Stage IVB 
 N2    ○ Four or more positive lymph nodes from the sites described for N1  
-------------------Distant Metastasis(M)--------------------- 
 M0   ○No distant metastasis (no pathologic M0; use clinical M to complete stage group) 
Stage IVB 
 M1   ○Distant metastasis□
