Findings: 
 
Mild infiltration with atelectasis or fibrotic band over bil. lower lungs. 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in the visual field. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
Mild splenomegaly.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver, compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Two hypodense nodules with early enhancement and early washout in S5/6(2.5cm) and S7(1.6 cm) liver, suggestive of hepatocellular carcinomas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
A 0.8cm soft tissue lesion in the fundus of gallbladder, r/o GB polyp.  
 
Patency of portal vein. 
 
Presence of gastric varices. 
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs. 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen. 
 
 
 
IMP:
