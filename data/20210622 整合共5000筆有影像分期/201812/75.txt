Findings: 
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in the visual field.  
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
Relatively low density of liver with good visualization of venous system, compatible with fatty liver.  
 
LLS and S7 hepatic cysts (0.4-0.9 cm). 
 
An enhancing nodule (3.1 cm) in S4-8 liver. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder. 
 
Patency of portal vein. 
 
Left adrenal nodule (2.2 cm). 
 
Bil. renal cysts. 
 
Left renal stones. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
Small visible retroperitoneal LNs.

IMP: 
 
* Compatible with S4-8 HCC (3.1 cm). 
 
* Fatty liver with LLS and S7 hepatic cysts (0.4-0.9 cm). 
 
* Left adrenal nodule (2.2 cm). Suggest further follow-up. 
 
* Bil. renal cysts, and left renal stones.
