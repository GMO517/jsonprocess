Findings: 
 
Multiple pulmonary nodules over bil. lower lungs,  suggestive of metastasis  . 
Minimal right pleural effusion. 
Multiple hypodense lobulated masses/nodules with poor enhancement noted in bil. lobes of liver, the largest one 9.8cm in S4/8 liver. 
Tumor invasion to right anterior PV and MHV(extended into SVC) 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Focal dilatation of S5 IHD. 
Small gallbladder stone.  
Patency of main portal vein   
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Minimal ascites. 
 
IMP:
