Findings: 
Filling defect in right pulmonary arteries due to pulmonary embolism 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple ill-defined enhanced liver nodular masses in both lobes, the biggest up to 10cm with early washout, favor HCCs 
Obliterated RHV and filling defect in IVC due to tumor thrombosis, also extending to right atrium 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
Mild ascites 
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
Large left adrenal metastasis, nodular mass up to 6.1cm  
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
Multiple large HCCs in both lobes, invasion to RHV and IVC also into right atrium 
Right pulmonary embolism 
Large left adrenal metastasis, nodular mass up to 6.1cm
