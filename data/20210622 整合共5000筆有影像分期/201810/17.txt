檢查項目: CT of Liver w/o Contrast 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Brief Hx: liver tumor, LC 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 1.7cm in S8 with early washout, favor HCC 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Mildly early enhanced liver nodule about 1.7cm in S8, favoring HCC
