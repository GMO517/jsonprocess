Imaging  Findings: 
Decrease attenuation of liver parenchymal may due to fatty change of liver 
An ill define mass (5.1X4X2.7cm) locate in S7-8 of liver, with early enhance and early washout in post-enhance study, more favor HCC 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Unremarkable of GB 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Left renal cysts, upto 1.7cm 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Moderate to severe fatty change of liver 
2. S7-8 enhance liver tumor(5.1cm), more favor HCC
