Imaging  Findings: 
Partial atelectasis of LLL 
Bilateral pleural effusion ,mild  
Mild lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A mass(4X3.6X3.8cm) in S2 liver near LHV with early enhance and early washout, favor HCC 
Favor focal tumor rupture over superior aspect of the tumor with hematoma around the left subphrenic area 
Hyperdense ascites in pelvic cavity may due to hemoperitoneum 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Not well distension of gallbladder with stones. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Prominent LNs over left gastric a. and CHA regions 
Enlargement of prostate gland 
Apparent decreased height of L1 vertebra body 
 
Impression:  
1.Cirrhotic change of liver 
2.Favor S2 HCC(4cm) with focal rupture over superior aspect of the tumor and hematoma  around the left subphrenic area 
3.Hyperdense ascites in pelvic cavity may due to hemoperitoneum 
4.Small gallstones
