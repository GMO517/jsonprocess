Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
One hypodense liver ndule about 3.1cm in S7 with mild early enahncement and washout, favor HCC 
Patency of the portal veins but recannalization of umbilical vein noted 
Mild splenomegaly and varices 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, gallstoens 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
Mild left renal stones with mild hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly, varices and gallstones 
One hypodense liver ndule (3.1cm) in S7 with early enahncement, favor HCC
