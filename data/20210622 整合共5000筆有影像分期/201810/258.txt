Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Numerous early enhanced liver nodules in both lobes, the biggest up to 14cm in S5-6 with early washout, favor HCCs 
Another small nodule about 2.7cm in S2 with sustained enhancement, favor hemangioma 
Patency of the portal veins, no evident portal thrombosis 
Focal hilar enlarged LNs up to 4.5cm 
No splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
Focal osteolytic destruction over spinoud process of L3 with 4.0 enhanced soft tissue mass, favor metastasis 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis 
Numerous early enhanced liver nodules in both lobes, the biggest up to 14cm in S5-6, favor HCCs, focal hilar enlarged LNs up to 4.5cm 
Bony metastasis over L3 spinous process with 4.0 soft tissue mass
