Findings: 
Calcified plaques over coronary arteries (may at risk of coronary disease). 
Heavy calcified plaques over aorta and other arterial structure.  
Mural thrombus over abdominal aorta (at renal level). 
Multiple pulmonary nodules in visual fields, favor metastatic lesions. 
Consolidation over bil. LLs. 
Bil. pleural effusion. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen. 
Heterogenous mass at pancreatic tail (8.1x4.8cm), favor malignancy. 
Multiple heterogenous nodules/masses over bilobar liver, favor metastatic lesions. 
Periportal edema. 
Poor visualized pancreatic veins, favor invasion. 
Dilatation of bil. IHDs. 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder.  
Patency of portal vein. 
Prominent hepatic porta lymph node (9.5mm).   
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Bil. calyceal stones. 
Calcifications over prostate gland. 
Wall thickening of urinary bladder. 
Suspicious enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal free air in the abdomen  . 
Ascites.  
No definite bone destruction. 
Subcutaneous calcifications over bil. gluteal region. 
Several enhancing nodules over dependent part of abdominal cavity, favor peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
Subcutaneous soft tissue edema.   
 
IMP: 
* Concerning pancreatic (tail) cancer with liver, lung and peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
* Suspicious enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs.
