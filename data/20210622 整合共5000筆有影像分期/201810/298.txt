Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A huge heterogenous enhance tumor (8.8X7.2X9.5cm) locate in S8 of liver, 
 
 favor HCC 
 
Multiple early enhance and early washout nodules in S8 and part of S4 liver 
 
 around the S8 big tumor, favor HCCs 
 
A 1.66cm early enhance and early washout nodule in S2-3 liver, favor HCC 
 
Mild dilatation of right IHDs 
 
The RHV,MHV and RPV were displaced by the tumor without obvious invasion 
 
Enlarge size LNs over portocaval and aortocaval region (〈1cm) 
 
Patent MPV and branches 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.Multiple tumors in S4,S8 and S2-3 liver, the biggest one about 9.5cm, 
 
 favor HCCs 
 
3.Mild dilatation of right IHDs 
 
4.The RHV,MHV and RPV were displaced by the tumor without obvious invasion
