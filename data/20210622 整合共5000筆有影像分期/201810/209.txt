Findings: 
 
Pulmonary nodules noted in RLL(0.8cm) and LLL(0.5cm), favoring metastasis. 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
Splenomegaly   
Multiple tumors with isoearly enhancement and early washout noted in bil. lobes of liver, the largest one 4.0cm in S4, favoring HCCs. 
Filling defects noted in MHV, favoring tumoral thrombus. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
Patency of portal vein   
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Large porta-systemic shunt over RLQ of abdomen with aneurym dilatation(3.3cm). 
Bony destruction over T12 vertbral body, favoring metastasis. 
 
IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly; Large porta-systemic shunt over RLQ of abdomen with aneurym dilatation(3.3cm). 
* Multiple bilobar HCCs with MHV invasion. 
* Pulmonary nodules noted in RLL(0.8cm) and LLL(0.5cm), favoring metastasis. 
* Bony destruction over T12 vertbral body, favoring metastasis.
