Findings:  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
Splenomegaly   
An early enhancement and early washout nodule in S4 liver (3.9 cm), favoring viable HCC. 
A 0.8 cm persistently enhanced nodule in S5 liver, favoring hepatic hemangioma. 
Multiple small hypodense lesions without definite enhancement in bilobar liver, maybe due to regenerative nodules. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
Bilateral renal cysts .  
No definite hydronephrosis  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Wall-thickening of non-fully expanded urinary bladder  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly   
* Multiple small hypodense lesions without definite enhancement in bilobar liver, maybe due to regenerative nodules. 
* An early enhancement and early washout nodule in S4 liver (3.9 cm), favoring viable HCC. 
* A 0.8 cm persistently enhanced nodule in S5 liver, favoring hepatic hemangioma.
