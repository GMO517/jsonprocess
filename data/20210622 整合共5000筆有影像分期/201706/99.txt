Findings: 
 
Heterogeneous appearance of liver parenchyma with mildly lobulated contour, suggestive of parenchymal liver disease 
 
Subtle ill-defined liver lesion with early enhancement and suspicious washout at S7(1.0cm), dysplastic vs. HCC 
 
Two nodules in S5 about 1.6cm and 2.5cm with poor enhancement and late washout, also can not exclude early HCCs 
 
Liver cyst at S7(0.4cm). 
 
Patent portal veins 
 
No biliary tree dilatation, tiny GB stone 
 
No splenomegaly  
 
No ascites 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs 
 
Unremarkable pancreas 
 
Right renal cyst(3.7mm) and right renal stone (1.4mm). 
 
IMP:   
 
Liver parenchymal disease 
 
Mild enhance liver nodules in S5 and S7 with late washout, highly suspect HCCs and not typical for hemangioma  
 
 
 
(tentative tumor staging for HCC without pathology)
