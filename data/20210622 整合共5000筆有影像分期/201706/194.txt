Findings:  
 
 
 
Pulmonary infiltration in bilateral posterior basal lungs.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Splenomegaly  
 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
 
Small ascites  
 
Multiple early enhancement and early washout nodules in bilobar liver (2.5 cm ~ 12.3 cm), highly suspected HCCs. 
 
Suspicious focal extravasation of contrast medium noted over LLS liver exophytic huge tumor (12.3 cm) ? 
 
A 2.2x1.5 cm enlarged LN over gastrohepatic ligament 
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
No definite bony destruction.  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly with ascites  
 
     * Multiple bilobar early enhancement and early washout nodules, favoring HCCs. 
 
     * A 2.2x1.5 cm enlarged LN over gastrohepatic ligament 
 
     * Suspicious focal extravasation of contrast medium noted over LLS liver exophytic huge tumor (12.3 cm), rupture of hepatoma ?
