Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver 
 
Multiple hypodense nodular masses in right lobe liver with mild enhancement, the biggest up to 10cm in S6-7, favoring HCCs 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas and spleen 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy   
 
Multiple osteolytic bony destructions over bil. sacrum, left iliacus and T-L spine, favor bone metastasis 
 
IMP: 
 
Multiple HCCs in right lobe with bone metastasis
