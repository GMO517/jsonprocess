Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Atrophic change of S4 liver 
 
Several tiny low attenuation cysts in liver(9mm) 
 
An ill demarginated mass (2.36X2.1X2.1cm) in S6 of liver, without  
 
 obvious early enhancement 
 
Mild dilatation of S6 IHD 
 
Presence of RIHV 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Mild dilatation of CBD=1.2cm 
 
Right renal lower calyx and left renal upper calyx stones 
 
Postoperative change of sigmoid colon 
 
Subtle mucosal lesion or tumor of colon could not be well detected by  
 
abdominal CT study

Impression:  
 
1.An ill demarginated mass (2.36X2.1X2.1cm) in S6 of liver, without  
 
 obvious early enhancement, due to metastasis or cholangiocarcinoma? 
 
2.Mild dilatation of S6 IHD 
 
3.Mild dilatation of CBD=1.2cm 
 
4.Right renal lower calyx and left renal upper calyx stones
