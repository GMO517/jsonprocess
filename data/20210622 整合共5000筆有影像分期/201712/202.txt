Report: Brief Hx: LC, liver tumors 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
 
Bil. pleural effusion 
 
Several lung nodules in bil. lobes, favor metastasis 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Numerous ill-defined liver nodules with enhancement in both lobes, the biggest about 12x16cm over S4-5 
 
Thrombosis of the left portal veins, patent RPV and MPV 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
Mild ascites 
 
Focal intrahepatic biliary dilatation may be due to mass effect 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
 
Multiple liver tumors in both lobes with left portal vein thrombosis 
 
Several lung nodules in bil. lobes, favor lung metastasis
