Imaging  Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous  
 
system compatible with fatty liver, favor severe fatty change of liver 
 
A 1.68cm cyst in high S8 liver 
 
A relatively hyperdense area in S2 liver (2.9X2.4cm) , difficult 
 
 to assess the enhancement pattern in this severe fatty liver case 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Severe fatty change of liver 
 
2.A 1.68cm cyst in high S8 liver 
 
3.A relatively hyperdense area/nodule in S2 liver (2.9X2.4cm), difficult 
 
  to assess the enhancement pattern in this severe fatty liver case, due 
 
  to tumor or focal fatty sparing? suggest MRI study.
