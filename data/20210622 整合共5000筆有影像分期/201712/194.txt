 Report: CT of liver with triphasic enhancement study shows:   
 
 
 
Techniques:  
 
The patient is lying on the CT table in supine position 
 
Non-enhanced &  Contrast enhanced CT study from lower chest to 
 
 kidney level in 5-mm & 5-mm contiguous section respectively. 
 
The arterial phase,  portovenous phase & equilibrium phase scan is  
 
performed  after initial contrast medium injection. 
 
   
 
Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Several low attenuation lesions in liver favor cysts(〈9mm) 
 
1.8cm early enhance and early washout tumor over LLS liver  
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Gallstones 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Small left renal cyst 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  .
