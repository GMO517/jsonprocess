       Report: CT of liver with triphasic enhancement study shows:   
 
 
 
Techniques:  
 
The patient is lying on the CT table in supine position 
 
Non-enhanced &  Contrast enhanced CT study from lower chest to 
 
 kidney level in 5-mm & 5-mm contiguous section respectively. 
 
The arterial phase,  portovenous phase & equilibrium phase scan is  
 
performed  after initial contrast medium injection. 
 
   
 
Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Three cysts in S2(5.9mm), S5(5.5mm) and S7(1.1cm) of liver 
 
Three nodules in S4(1.27cm), S5(0.78cm) and S3(0.94cm) of liver,  
 
with intense early enhancement and persist enhance in late phase, 
 
favor hemangioma 
 
A well define mass (2.65cm) in S7 liver with early enhance and  
 
early washout, favor HCC 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
A 1.57cm cystic lesion in pancreatic tail 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Right renal cyst(1.78cm) 
 
A 2cm lipoma over mid anterior abdominal wall of mid abdomen 
 
Calcify uterine mass or myoma(1.5cm,0.98cm) 
 
Uterine myoma (2.8cm) 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
The volumetric of right and left liver is 533cm3 and 100cm3 respectively 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.Three nodules in S4(1.27cm), S5(0.78cm) and S3(0.94cm) of liver,  
 
more favor hemangioma 
 
3.A well define mass (2.65cm) in S7 liver with early enhance and  
 
early washout, favor HCC 
 
4.Liver cysts 
 
5.Pancreatic tail cyst 
 
6.Right renal cysts 
 
7.Uterine myoma, some are calcify myoma 
 
8.Lipoma in anterior abdominal wall
