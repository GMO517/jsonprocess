Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple early enhanced liver nodules in S4 (1.0cm), S4-8 (1.4 & 1.8cm), S5-8 (2.1cm) and S6 (1.1cm) with early washout, more favoring HCCs 
 
Patency of the portal veins but partial thrombosis in RPV nature? 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
Moderate ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but tiny gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Multiple early enhanced liver nodules in right lobe and S4 liver (1.0-2.1cm) with early washout, favoring HCCs 
 
Partial thrombosis in RPV, nature?
