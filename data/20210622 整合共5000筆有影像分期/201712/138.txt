    Report: Brief Hx: liver tumor, 5.4cm, history of colon cancer 
 
This study has been compared to the previous study at 2011 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
No obvious focal liver nodule 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
No splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
Obliterated GB with stones and soft tissue mass about 3.5x5.0cm with enhancemnt, favor GB tumor with invasion to S5  
 
Several enlared periportal LNs up to 1.3cm 
 
No evident IHD dilatation 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
s/p LAR with colostomy over LLQ. 
 
Bil. moderate hydronephrosis with caliceal stones, suspected bil. ureteral obstruction nature? 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Gallstones and suspcious GB tumor with mass about 3.5x5.0cm and invasion to S5, periportal enlarged LNs   
 
s/p LAR with colostomy over LLQ. 
 
Bil. moderate hydronephrosis with caliceal renal stones due to bil. ureteral obstruction nature?
