       Report: Brief Hx: liver tumor, big, cholangiocarcinoma 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
Findings: 
 
Consolidation of RLL lung 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with chronic liver disease 
 
Large ill-defined hypodense mass about 6.6x9.0cm with mild enhancement in high S4-8, the tumor margin is obliterated with HVs and IVC 
 
The tumor invasion through the diaphragm also noted 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
Mild ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Ill-defined large tumor over high S4-8 liver with invasion through diaphragm, compatible with cholangioca
