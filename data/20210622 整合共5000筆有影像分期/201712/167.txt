Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
 
 
Partial obliteration of the left and main portal veins due to tumor invasion 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
Diffuse bil. intrahepatic biliary dilatation due to ill-defined hypodense tumor mass at least 5cm r/o cholangioca 
 
Hyperdense content in GB may be sandish stones, mild GB wall thickening noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
Right renal cyst about 4.3cm noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Diffuse intrahepatic biliary dilatation due to ill-defined hypodense tumor mass at least 5cm with portal invasion, favor cholangioca

Stage 0 
 
 Tis   ○Carcinoma in situ 
 
Stage I 
 
 T1    ○Tumor confined to the bile duct, with extension up to the muscle layer or fibrous tissue 
 
Stage II 
 
 T2a   ○Tumor invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue 
 
 T2b   ○Tumor invades adjacent hepatic parenchyma 
 
Stage IIIA 
 
 T3    ○Tumor invades unilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery 
 
Stage IVA (T4 N0-N1) 
 
 T4    ●Tumor invades main portal vein or its branches bilaterally; or the common hepatic artery; or the second-order biliary radicals bilaterally; or unilateral 
 
second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement
