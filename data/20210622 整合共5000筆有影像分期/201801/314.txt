   Report: Brief Hx: A 60 y/o male with liver tumor  
 
 
 
CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
 
Contrast agent  injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
 
 
 
Findings: 
 
 
 
A 4.9mm pulmonary nodule noted in RLL. 
 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous system compatible with fatty liver  . 
 
An early enhancing and early washout tumor(3.5cm) noted in S5 liver, favoring HCC. 
 
Another poor enhancing nodule(2.2cm) noted in S7 liver, r/o HCC 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
No bony destruction. 
 
Prostate calcification. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Fatty liver. 
 
* Favoring HCCs in S5(3.5cm) and S7(2.2cm) liver. 
 
* A 4.9mm pulmonary nodule noted in RLL.
