Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A 1.52cm nodule in S3-4 liver near surface with early enhance and  
 
early washout, favor HCC 
 
Another hypodense nodule(7.8mm) without enhancement in S6-7 liver 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S3-4 liver nodule (1.52cm) with enhancement, favor HCC 
 
3.S6-7 hypodense nodule, favor regenerative nodule.
