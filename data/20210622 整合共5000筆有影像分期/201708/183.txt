Imaging  Findings: 
 
Three nodular opacities (3-4mm) in subpleural region of LLL 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Three mass in S8(2.8cm) and S4-8(4cm) of liver, early enhance  
 
and early washout 
 
Aother esophytic tumor in high S4 liver (2.8cm), early enhance 
 
 and early washout 
 
Several liver cysts(〈1cm) 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Right renal cysts (〈2.3cm) 
 
Two hypodense mass lesion in mid pole of left kidney(about 2cm) 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Ascites 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
 
2.Favor three HCCs in S8, S4-8 and S4 liver, one exophytic tumor  
 
from high S4 liver 
 
3.Liver and renal cysts 
 
4.Suspect left renal hypodense lesions or nodules, nature? 
 
5.LLL subpleural nodules(3-4mm), nature?
