Pulmonary infiltration in left lingular segment and bil. lower lobes. 
 
A calcified spot in right subphrenic fat 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Splenomegaly   
 
A large heterogeneous mass(9.9x6.4cm) in right liver with right anterior portal vein thrombosis, compatible with HCC. 
 
Multiple small( all〈 2.0 cm) mild enhancement lesions in spleen, suspect hemangiomas. 
 
A 1.06 cm accessory spleen in inferior parsplenic region. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.

Imp.:  
 
(1) Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
 
(2) Multiple patch relative low density in both lobes of the liver with good visualization of venous system, compatible with inhomogeneous fatty liver. 
 
(3) Multiple small( all〈 2.0 cm) mild enhancement lesions in spleen, suspect hemangiomas. 
 
(4) No eraly enhancement tumor in the liver.
