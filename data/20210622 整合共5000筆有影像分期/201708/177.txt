Imaging findings:  
 
A hepatic cyst at the S8 about 0.7cm  
 
Two hepatic nodules in the S5 about 4.6 and 1.8cm, maybe due to hepatocellular carcinomas 
 
No obvious dilatation of the biliary tree and no stone in it  
 
No definite evidence of portal vein thrombosis  
 
No definite enlarged lymph nodes noted at visualized fields  
 
No hydronephrosis or hydroureter noted  
 
No definite evidence of pneumoperitoneum or ascites noted  
 
A right renal cyst  
 
No obvious bony destruction detected   
 
 
 
Impression: Two hepatic nodules in the S5 about 4.6 and 1.8cm, maybe due to hepatocellular carcinomas
