Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple hypodense liver nodules in bil. lobes about 0.7cm in LLS, 0.9cm in S4, 1.6cm in S5 and 1.0cm in S6 with equivocal enhancement, regenerative nodules? the nature can not exclude HCCs

Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis but tiny right renal stone noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
 
 
IMP:

Multiple small hypodense liver nodules in bil. lobes, nature to be determined
