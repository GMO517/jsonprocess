 
Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with chronic liver disease 
 
Two early enhanced early wash-out liver tumors in S8 (6.1 and 1.3cm), favoring HCCs 
 
Hypodense liver nodules about 1.0cm in S6 and LLS with persistent enhancement, favoring hemangiomas 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Right hepatic vein is compressed by S8 liver tumor. 
 
No splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis over left side 
 
Small left renal cyst about 0.8cm 
 
s/p right nephrectomy 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Favoring HCCs in S8 liver 
 
* Right hepatic vein is compressed by S8 liver tumor. 
 
* Hemengiomas in S6 and LLS liver.
