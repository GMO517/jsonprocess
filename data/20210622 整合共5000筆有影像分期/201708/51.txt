Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
A tumor mass in S6-7 liver (4.6X3.7X5.4cm) with early enhance and 
 
 early washout, favor HCC 
 
Partial thrombus in posterior branch of RPV 
 
The mass close to the RHV with suspicious RHV invasion 
 
Presence of RIHV 
 
Patent MPV, RAPV, and LPV 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
S/P hysterectomy 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S6-7 liver tumor favor HCC, partial thrombus in RPPV and invade RHV
