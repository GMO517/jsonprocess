CT of liver without & with contrast enhancement triphasic scans shows:  
 
* This study is compared with previous study on 2015/08/19 . 
 
Infiltration in bilateral lower lobes. 
Calcified plaques in coronary arteries.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
Lobulated, ill-defined, early enhancing, early wash-out mass in S4-8 of liver measuring about 4.8x2.9cm in size. Some tiny satellite nodules are also noted. 
Some small poor enhancing nodules in LLS of liver. May be due to dysplastic nodules. 
S4 (1.4cm) and S8 (0.31cm) hepatic cysts. 
Splenomegaly   
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No definite biliary dilatation but with multiple gall stones 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Bilateral renal cysts up to 1.4cm. 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
One 0.57cm calcification in the greater omentum. Due to calcified omental LN? 
Patency of the portal vein 
S/P dual-chamber pacemaker implantation with leads in the right atrium and ventricle 
 
IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly   
* Early enhancing, early wash-out tumor in S4-8 of liver. Suspicious for HCC.   
* S4 and S8 hepatic cysts. 
* multiple gall stones
