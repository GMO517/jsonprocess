Findings:  
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
 
A 2.4 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S5 liver, favor viable HCC. 
 
Two early and persisted strongly enhanced nodule over S4 (1.2 cm) and S6-7 (1.74 cm) of the liver 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the right with size of 0.7 cm .  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Small but visible retroperitoneal LNs. 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
IUD in the pelvic cavity  . 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Favor hemangioma over S4 and S6 liver. 
 
     * A 2.4 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S5 liver, favor viable HCC.
