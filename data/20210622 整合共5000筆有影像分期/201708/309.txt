Findings: 
 
Atelectasis of bil. lower lungs and bil. pleural effusion 
 
A 0.9cm lung nodule in LLL may be metastasis 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis

Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
Mild ascites 
 
Focal polypoid mass about 3.5x5.5cm over lower abdomen may be sigmoid colon cancer 
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
Left renal cyst about 3.8cm over upper pole 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs
