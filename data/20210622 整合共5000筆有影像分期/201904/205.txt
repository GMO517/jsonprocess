Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
A 1.5 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S6 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
Suspicious RPV posterior branch invasion 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
Right lower calyceal stone (3 mm), but no definite hydronephrosis  
Bil renal pelviectasia 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Enlarged prostate with a 2.2 cm enhanced nodule, suggest follow up 
No definite bony destruction.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
