Findings: 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  
Splenomegaly 
Multiple ill-defined early enhanced liver nodules in right lobe with early washout, the biggest about 4x5cm over hilar region, favor HCCs 
Thrombosis of right portal vein and partial in MPV 
Bil. IHD dilatation may due to hilar tumor invasion 
Multiple gallstones also noted 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen  
No definite obstructive uropathy  
Left renal cyst (3.9cm) 
No dilatation of bowel loop 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
Mild ascites 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly; mild ascites and gallstones 
Favoring multiple HCCs over right lobe and hilar region with portal thrombosis and IHD dilatation
