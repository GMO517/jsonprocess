Imaging  Findings: 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A heterogenous enhance mass (4X5.3X4.5cm) in S8 liver favor HCC 
A 2.8cm mass in peripheral of S2 liver with early enhance and central necrotic area, favor HCC 
A 1.83cm hypodense nodule in S6-7 liver noted in late phase without obvious early enhancement, due to regenerative nodule or early washout HCC? 
Two early enhance nodules in S2(9mm) and S5-6(1.36cm) liver, isodense during late phase, suspicious HCCs 
Thrombosis of LLS portal branches 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Tiny gallstone 
No definite obstructive uropathy. Left renal cyst(1.5cm) 
Several prominent upper retroperitoneum LNs 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Liver cirrhosis 
2. Heterogenous enhance tumors in S8(5.3cm) and S2 (2.8cm) liver favor HCCs 
3. Two early enhance nodules in S2(9mm) and S5-6(1.36cm) liver, suspicious HCCs 
4. A 1.83cm hypodense nodule in S6-7 liver, due to regenerative nodule or early washout HCC? 
5. Thrombosis of LLS portal branches
