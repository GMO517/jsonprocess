Findings:  
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in RML and RLL 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
A 1.9 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S5 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
Multiple small cysts over the liver 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Gallstones (up to 0.8 cm) without definite wall-thickening of gallbladder.  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Patency of the portal vein 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No definite bony destruction.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP:  
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly with gallstone 
* A 1.9 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S5 liver, favoring viable HCC.
