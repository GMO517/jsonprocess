Imaging  Findings: 
Focal atelectasis of lingular lobe 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
No obvious early enhance mass in liver 
A hypodense nodule(1.6X1X1.2cm) noted in S6 liver without early enhancement 
Splenomegaly 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
Prominent splenorenal shunt 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Gallstones 
No definite obstructive uropathy  .Left renal cyst(1cm) 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Mild ascites 
 
Impression:  
1. Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
2. A new hypodense nodule(1.6X1X1.2cm) noted in S6 liver without early enhancement,  suspect regenerative nor dysplastic nodule, but can''t exclude HCC with early washout due  to elevated AFP. 
3. Gallstones 
4. Mild ascites
