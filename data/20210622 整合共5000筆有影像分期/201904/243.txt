Findings: 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous system compatible with fatty liver  . 
A hypodense nodule(2.8cm) with poor early enhancing and early washout noted in S2 liver, favoring HCC 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
Patency of portal vein   
Tiny left renal calyceal stone. 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
No bony destruction. 
 
IMP: 
* Fatty liver. 
* Favoring HCC(2.8cm) in S2 liver.
