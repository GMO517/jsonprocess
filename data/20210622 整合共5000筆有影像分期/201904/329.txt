Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple ill-defined nodular liver masses in both lobes, the biggest up to 7x8cm in S7-8, early enhancement of the lesions, favoring HCCs 
Thrombosis of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
Multiple enlarged hilar, periportal and periceliac trunk LNs, the biggest up to 2.7cm 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Multiple HCCs over both lobes (the biggest 8cm) with portal thrombosis 
Multiple enlarged hilar, periportal and periceliac trunk LNs
