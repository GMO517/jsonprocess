Imaging  Findings: 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A well define mass (2.1X2.6cm) in S4a liver near surface, with early enhancement, more favor HCC 
Splenomegaly, accessory spleen(1.5cm) 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
Recanalization of umbilical vein 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly 
2. An enhance mass (2.1X2.6cm) in S4a liver near surface, more favor HCC
