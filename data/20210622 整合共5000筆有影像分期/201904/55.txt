Brief Hx: Liver mixed-echoic tumor at LLS (2.3cm), HCC or metastatic tumor? 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
Techniques:  
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, contrast medium injected, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
Findings: 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
One hypodense liver lesion about 2.6cm in LLS with poor enhancement, nature? r/o HCC also can not exclude metastasis 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
One hypodense liver lesion (2.6cm) in LLS with poor enhancement, nature?
