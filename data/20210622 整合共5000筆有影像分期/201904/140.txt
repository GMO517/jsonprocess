Imaging  Findings: 
Focal atelectasis in lingular lobe 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A 3.26cm mass in S7 liver with early enhancement, near isodense during late phase, not seen in prior liver CT and MRI study, suspect HCC 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
Bil. renal cysts, upto 1.4cm 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Enlargement of prostate gland 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Impression:  
1. Liver cirrhosis 
2. A 3.26cm enhance mass in S7 liver, not seen in prior liver CT & MRI, suspect HCC
