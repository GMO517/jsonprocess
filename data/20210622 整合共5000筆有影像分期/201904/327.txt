Findings: 
Mild right pleural effusion 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
Large ill-defined hetergenous enhanced mass about 9x12x13cm in S6-7-8 with some late hypodense washout, r/o HCC or CHC 
Patency of the portal veins but partial obliteration of RPV may due to tumor invasion, focal periportal enlarged LNs up to 1.3cm also noted

No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen 
Bil. small renal cysts  
Tiny right renal stone, no right hydronephrosis 
Multiple left renal stones with moderate hydronephrosis 
IMP: 
Large ill-defined hetergenous enhanced liver mass about 9x12x13cm in S6-7-8 with RPV invasion r/o HCC or cholangioca 
Bil. renal stones, moderate left hydronephrosis
