Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple early enhancing liver nodules over bil. lobes with early washout, favor HCCs, the biggest liver nodule about 1.7cm in LLS 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
Moderate amount of ascites 
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP:
