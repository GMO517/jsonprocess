Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
 
Ill-defined infiltrated liver mass about 9cm in S4, another small nodules about 1.6-2.7cm in LLS with poor enhancement and focal dilated left IHDs, favoring cholangioca 
 
Obliterated LPV may be due to tumor invasion 
 
Patency of the right and main portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
Left adrenal nodule about 2.0cm may be adenoma 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Infiltrated liver tumor mass and nodules in S4 & LLS with obliterated LPV and dilated left IHDs r/o cholangioca  
 
Left adrenal nodule about 2.0cm may be adenoma
