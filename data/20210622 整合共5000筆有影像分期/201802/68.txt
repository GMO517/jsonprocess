Findings: 
 
Multiple lung nodules over bil. lower lobes may be metastasis 
 
Numerous liver nodules in both lobes with early enahncement, the biggest about 8.5cm in S4, mild washout in late phase, tumor nature may be HCC or other 
 
Large tumor mass in IVC and right atrium may be tumor invasion 
 
Multiple enlarged LNs over periportal region up to 2.0cm 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Suspicious HCCs in both lobes with tumor invasion to IVC and right atrium  
 
Bil. lung metastasis and also periportal LN invasion 
 
 
 
(tentative tumor staging for HCC)
