Findings: 
 
2 early enhanced and washed out tumor over LLS (3.86cm) and S8 liver (1cm) 
 
A fatty lesion in S6 liver about 1.3 cm may be angiomyolipoma or lipoma 
 
No definite biliary dilatation . 
 
Collapsed gallbladder.  
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas and spleen 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen . 
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
s/p left nephrectomy 
 
Right renal tiny calcifications ,  
 
Multiple right renal cysts but some with higher attenuation may due to proteinous content, no inteval change . 
 
s/p CAPD catheter over left lower peritoneal cavity 
 
It can not well dectect any isodense lesion without IV contrast study 
 
 
 
IMP:  
 
2 tumors over LLS and S8 liver, HCC? 
 
* s/p left nephrectomy, no apparent recurrent mass 
 
* Polycystic renal disease  
 
* A fatty lesion in S6 liver about 1.3cm may be angiomyolipoma or lipoma
