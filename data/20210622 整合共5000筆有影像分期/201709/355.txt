Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Large mixed hyperdense and hypodense liver nodular mass about 8x11x15cm in right lobe 
 
Several small liver cysts in bil lobes 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas  
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No splenomegaly 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy 
 
It can not well dectect any isodense lesion without IV contrast study
