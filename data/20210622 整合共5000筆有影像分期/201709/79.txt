Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Two mass lesions in S5 liver (4.2X3.6cm,4.6X4.1cm) with early enhance 
 
 and early washout, favor HCCs 
 
Several low attenuation lesions in liver favor cysts(〈2.6cm) 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Gallstone(1.48cm) 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Enlargement of prostate gland 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
The size of the right liver is 659cm3, the left liver is 459cm3 and  
 
the spleen is 177cm3 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S5 liver tumors, favor HCCs (4.2X3.6cm,4.6X4.1cm) 
 
3.Gallstone
