 
Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver 
 
Early enhanced and washed out tumors about 2.1 and 1.2cm in LLS, 1.3cm in S4 
 
Multiple poor enhanced tumors (0.5-1.9cm) are noted over both lobes of the liver 
 
Splenomegaly   
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No definite biliary dilatation but with multiple gall stones 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Patency of the portal vein 
 
Bilateral small kidneys and with multiple cysts, favor polycystic kidneys 
 
Moderate left hydronephrosis and dilated ureter due to distal ureteral mass about 2.0cm, suspect distal ureteral tumor 
 
IMP:  
 
Gallstones 
 
Multiple tumors over both lobe of the liver 
 
Three early enhancing nodules in LLS and S4 may due to HCCs 
 
Chronic renal failure, polycystic kidneys 
 
Left hydronephrosis and suspected distal ureteral tumor
