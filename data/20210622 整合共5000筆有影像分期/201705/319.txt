Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple liver nodular masses in both lobes, the biggest up to 11x13cm over right lobe with mass effect to the RPV and RHV 
 
The liver tumors with early enahnce and early washout, compatible with HCCs  
 
Patency of the left and main portal veins, obliterated RPV may be due to mass effect 
 
Multiple livr cysts in bil. lobes, the biggest size up to 3.2cm 
 
Moderate splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
 
Multiple HCCs in both lobes, the biggest 11x13 in right lobe
