Imaging  Findings: 
 
A 6.3mm nodule in left lingular lobe 
 
Ill demarginated hypodense tumor in S7,S8,S6 liver(11.6X8.7cm), 
 
 another hypodense nodule(1.4cm) in S2 liver 
 
The tumor may partial invade the right anterior PV and also invade 
 
 the right posterior PV 
 
Patent MPV and LPV 
 
Focal AP shung noted in S2 liver 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Mild dilatation of left IHD 
 
Right adrenal gland hypodense mass(2.1cm), favor metastasis tumor 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Ill demarginated hypodense tumor in S7,S8,S6 liver(11.6X8.7cm), 
 
 another hypodense nodule(1.4cm) in S2 liver, compatible with  
 
 cholangiocarcinoma 
 
2.The tumor may partial invade the right anterior PV and also invade 
 
 the right posterior PV  
 
3.Right adrenal gland hypodense mass(2.1cm), favor metastasis tumor
