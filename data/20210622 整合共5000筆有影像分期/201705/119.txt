Imaging  Findings: 
 
Several nodules in LLL  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A 2.3cm mass in S4-5 liver with early enhance and early washout, favor 
 
 HCC 
 
Four hypodense nodules in S4(6.3mm), S8 (8.7mm,7.8mm) and S6(11.4mm) liver 
 
 without enhancement, favor regenerative nodule 
 
A 6.5mm cyst in S6 liver 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Old fracture in left iliac bone 
 
Apparent decreased height of L3  
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S4-5 enhance mass (2.3cm) favor HCC 
 
3.Four hypodense nodules in S4(6.3mm), S8 (8.7mm,7.8mm) and S6(11.4mm) liver, 
 
 suspect regenerative nodules 
 
4.Several nodules in LLL, more favor inflammatory nodules
