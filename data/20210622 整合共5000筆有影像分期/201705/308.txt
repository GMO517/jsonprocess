 
Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Poorly defined hypodense liver tumor masses over right posterior portion about up to 5.4cm, mild enahncement 
 
Diffuse dilatation of biliary tree due to hilar obstruction, masses in the dilated posr IHDs and CHD also noted s/p ERBD stents and PTCD from left approach 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Enlarged periportal and hilar LNs up to 1.7cm  
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Favoring cholangioca over S6-7 with hilar obstruction causing diffuse biliary tree dilatation, hilar enlarged LNs 
 
 
 
(tentative tumor staging for cholangioca)
