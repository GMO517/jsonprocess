Findings: 
 
A pulmomary nodule(0.41cm) in RLL. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis   
 
Tiny calcifications in S6 liver. 
 
Multiple small low attenuated lesions in bil. lobes over S3 and S8, favor liver cysts 
 
Ill-definite mass(8.95cm) with early enhancement and early washout and non-opacification of S3 portal vein, favoring LLS HCC with S3 portal vein invasion. 
 
Several patch early enhnaced lesions in peripheral region of liver, focap AP shunts? 
 
Patency of the mian and mian radicle of portal veins 
 
Marked splenomegaly  
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Multiple gallstones. 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen, no ascites 
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
 
 
IMP:  
 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly
