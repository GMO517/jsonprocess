Findings: 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in the visual field. 
 
Enhancing masses with necrotic change about 5.8x2.7cm in left adrenal gland and lower pole of left kidney 
 
Suspicious thrombosis in left renal vein and IVC. 
 
Left upper calyces dilataiton due to mass effect 
 
Ascites in pelvic cavity 
 
Multilple infiltrative early enhancing tumor with necrotic change in bilateral lobes liver. 
 
Multiple enlarged lymph nodes with necrotic change in paraaortic and pararenal region.  
 
Mild dilated CHD about 0.8cm due to stenotic lesion at CBD. 
 
Patency of main trunk and bilateral portal veins. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas.

IMP: 
 
* More favoring left renal RCC with thrombosis in left renal vein and IVC and metastativ lesions over left adrenal gland, liver, and LNs over retrocaval and paraaortic region(Tentative imaging staging: T3bN1M1). 
 
* Ascites in pelvic cavity 
 
* Mild dilated CHD about 0.8cm due to stenotic lesion at CBD.
