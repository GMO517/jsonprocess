Findings: 
 
Several cystic air space in RML and RLL. 
 
Infiltration in bil. LLs. 
 
A early enhanced and washout liver nodule in S5 liver(4.6x6.4 cm), suggesting hepatocellular carcinoma.  
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
 
Right renal cyst.  
 
No definite adrenal mass. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal free air in the abdomen  . 
 
Hemoperitoneum. 
 
No apparent bone destruction. 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
1. Favoring HCC with rupture and hemoperitoneum (no definite active extravasation of contrast medium); tentative staging T4N0 in this study.
