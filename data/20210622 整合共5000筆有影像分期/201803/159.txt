Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Two hypodense nodular liver masses in S8 (1.3cm) and S6 (2.2cm) with early enhancement and washout, compatible with HCCs 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly, no ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No obvious enlargement of retroepritooneal LN 
 
No hydronephrosis over left side 
 
Mild right hydronephrosis may be due to distal ureteral obstruction, no evident ureteral stone but suspect small tumor over U-V junction 
 
IMP:  
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Two enhanced lvier nodular mass in S6 (2.2cm) and S8 (1.3cm), favor HCCs 
 
Right hydronephrosis may be due to distal ureteral obstruction, suspect small tumor mass at U-V junction
