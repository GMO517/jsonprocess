Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
About three cysts in S8 and S7 liver(〈1cm) 
 
Two nodules in S8(1.65cm) and S6(1.9cm) of liver, with early enhance 
 
 and early washout, favor HCCs 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the liver,pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.Gallstone(1.7cm), no wall thickening 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  .
