Liver CT without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies:  
 
No previous abdominal CT available to be compared.  
Findings:  
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in RML and LLL 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Splenomegaly  
An early enhancement and early washout nodule in S7-8 liver (3.0 cm ), favoring viable HCC 
Patency of portal vein.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
Diffuse atherosclerotic change of visualized vessels.  
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
     * An early enhancement and early washout nodule in S7-8 liver (3.0 cm ), favoring viable HCC
