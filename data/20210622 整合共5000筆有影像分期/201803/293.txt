Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Enhanced liver nodule about 6.2cm and another cyst (3.1cm) in S6 
Patency of the portal veins but partial thrombus in MPV  
Large ill-defined pancreatic head mass about 8x10cm with mass effect to PVs and SMV 
Moderate splenomegaly 
Mild ascites 
Diffuse biliary tree dilatation due to distal obstruction 
Multiple enlarged LNs over peripancreatic, periportal, pericaval and periaortic regions, up to 3.5cm, favor metastasis 
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
Favor pancreatic head cancer with perifocal invasion, enlarged LNs and diffuse biliary dilatation, partial MPV thrombus
