findings:  
a 1.7 cm enlarged periesophageal ln.
three nodules in rll (0.8 and 0.6 cm) and lll (0.4 cm).
no definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas.
lobulated contour of liver, compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
splenomegaly.
two heterogenous enhancing masses (upto 12x11x11 and 1 cm) in s6/7 liver with 
bil. and main portal vein invasion result in multiple collaterals.
a 7.7x5.7x4.5 cm exophytic mass arise from s6/7 probably with right adrenal 
gland invasion.
the tumor compressing the ivc.
probably a 0.6 cm cyst in lls.
no definite biliary dilatation.
unremarkable study of gallbladder.
patency of portal vein.
no definite hydronephrosis
right renal cysts
no apparent adrenal mass left.
multiple small retroperitoneal lns.
no abnormal  free air in the abdomen. 
small ascites.
no apparent bone destruction.
kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine ct
.
