Reason for Exam:  
 
       Report: Brief Hx: Tumor evaluation+ volumetry 
 
CT of Liver without and with IV enhancement triphasic scans studies   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section, about 80ml of contrast medium injected at 2ml/sec, arterial phase scan starting at 30 sec after initiation of injection; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase; and venous phase scan at 20 sec after the end of the portal phase  
 
 
 
Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple small liver cysts in bil. lobes, the largest one in S3 about 2.0cm 
 
One hypodense nodular mass in S5 about 4.8cm with early enhancement and early washout, compatible with HCC 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but multiple gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis but tiny renal cysts noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
Volumetry of the right lobe liver is  803cm3 and left lobe is  495cm3 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Multiple liver cysts in bil. lobes, gallstones 
 
One early enhanced liver tumor in S5 with early washout, favor HCC
