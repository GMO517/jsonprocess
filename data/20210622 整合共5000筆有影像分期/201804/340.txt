Findings: 
 
Bil. lower lung pulmonary and pleural nodules, favor metastasis 
Right pleural effusion.  
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Splenomegaly 
Prominent gastric varices . 
Multiple ill define conglomerated early washout tumors (largest one 13cm) in bilateral liver with right portal vein , right HV and IVC invasion 
Portal vein trombosis with Carveneous transformation over liver hilar region. 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
Gallbladder stone. 
Right adrenal nodule (2.1cm). 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No  free air in the abdomen  . 
Ascites in right subphrenic, perihepatic, right paracolic guttre and pelvic cavity  
No definite bone destruction. 
T12 compression fracture s/p vertebroplasty.

IMP: 
 
1.Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly. 
2.Bilobar early washout hepatic conglomerated tumors, favor HCCs. Right portal vein , IVC, right hepatic vein invasion noted. 
3.Bil.lower lung and pleural tumors due to metastasis. 
4.Portal vein tumoral thrombosis . 
5.Right adrenal nodule, metastasis?
