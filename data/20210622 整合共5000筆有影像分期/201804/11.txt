Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Multiple low attenuation cysts in liver upto 1.5cm 
 
An well encapsulated tumor (4.9X4.3X4.6cm) locate in S2 of liver, 
 
 with central hypodense or necrotic part and peripheral early enhance 
 
 and early washout, favor HCC 
 
Some hyperdensity within the central hypodense area due to prior 
 
 hemorrhage? 
 
A 0.78cm early enhance nodule in S2-3 liver become isodense during 
 
 late phase, due to HCC or hemangioma? 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
Double RPV, RAPV arise from LPV 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No splenomegaly or varices 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Gallstones 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Small left renal cysts 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Calcification of prostate gland 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S2 liver tumor(4.9cm) with central necrotic part or prior internal 
 
 hemorrhage, more favor HCC 
 
3.Small enhance nodule(0.78cm) in S2-3 liver, suspect HCC or hemangioma 
 
4.Liver and renal cysts
