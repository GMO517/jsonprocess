Findings:  
 
 
 
Pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lungs.  
 
A early enhancement and early washout nodule (2.6 cm) at S7 liver , favor viable HCC. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
A 0.75 cm small LN at hepatoduodenal ligament. 
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
A tiny left renal nodule with fat contens (7 mm), maybe due to hamartoma . 
 
Moderate compression fracture (Grade 2, 25-40%) over T12 spinal body.  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy.  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
Wall-thickening of non-fully expanded urinary bladder . 
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Favor S7 liver viable HCC (2.6 cm) 
 
     * Left renal hamartoma (0.7 cm)
