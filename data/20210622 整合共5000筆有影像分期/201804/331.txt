Findings:  
 
 
 
A 5.6 mm clacification over LLL, maybe due to granuloma. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Two non-enhancing hypodense lesions at S6-7 (7 mm & 5.5 mm), maybe due to cysts. 
 
A 3.05 cm early washout nodule without definite enhancement at S5 liver, HCC or regenerative nodule ? 
 
Splenomegaly  
 
Ascites. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy.  
 
No definite bony destruction.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis with ascites and splenomegaly. 
 
     * S6-7 liver cysts. 
 
     * A 3.05 cm early washout nodule without definite enhancement at S5 liver, HCC 
 
 or regenerative nodule ? Suggest further study for correlation.
