Imaging  Findings: 
Nasogastric tube in place  . 
A 3.5mm calcify nodule in RML 
Consolidation and shrinkage over bil.LL  
Bilateral pleural effusion   
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis, atrophy of LLS liver 
Several hypodense area in spleen may due to splenic infarct 
A big heterogenous enhance tumor (10X9.8X12.6cm) in S6,S7 liver with right posterior PV invasion with thrombosis 
Patent MPV, RAPV,LPV 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  .Bilateral renal cyst(1.6cm) 
Edematous change of wall of A-colon and stomach 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  .
