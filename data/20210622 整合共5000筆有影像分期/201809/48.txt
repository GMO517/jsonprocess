Findings  
Focal infiltration over RLL 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis  
Moderate splenomegaly and varices 
Recanalization of the umbilical vein 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 2.2cm in S6 with early washout 
No definite biliary dilatation but multiple gallstones are noted 
Patency of the portal veins 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas  
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No definite obstructive uropathy    
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and varices 
Multiple gallstones. 
One early enhanced/ washout liver nodule about 2.2cm in S6, favor HCC 
(tentative tumor staging)
