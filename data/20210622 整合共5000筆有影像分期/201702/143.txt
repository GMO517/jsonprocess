Imaging  Findings: 
 
Three tiny nodular opacities with calcification in RML and bil.LL, 
 
 favor calcify granuloma 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A 4.1X3.5X4.1cm mass in S8 liver near surface, with early enhance and 
 
 early washout, favor HCC 
 
A 1.5cm wedge shape focal enhance lesion over S2 liver, isodense in late 
 
 phase, favor focal AP shunt 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Bilateral small renal calyx stones, no hydronephrosis 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Focal mural thrombus in abdominal aorta 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S8 liver tumor (4.1cm), favor HCC
