Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
S/P RFA with necrosis and hypodense change(1.86cm) in S8 
 
A 8.4mm nodule in S4 liver near MHV with early enhance and washout, 
 
 favor HCC 
 
Three nodules in S6(1.15cm) and high S2(6.6mm, 1.26cm) liver with 
 
 early enhancement, suspect HCC 
 
A 5.6mm early enhance nodule in S2 liver with AP shunting 
 
Two cysts in S2 and S3 liver(〈6mm) 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Tiny right renal calyx stone 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S/P RFA with necrosis and hypodense change(1.86cm) in S8 
 
3.Multiple enhance nodules in S6,S2,S4 liver, more favor recurrent HCCs, 
 
 and focal AP shunting noted in S2 liver
