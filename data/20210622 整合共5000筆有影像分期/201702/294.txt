Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver 
 
One liver nodule about 1.8cm in LLS with early enhancement and waerly washout, favor HCC 
 
Small hypodense liver nodule about 1.0cm in S5-8, no interval change 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
No splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 1.8cm in LLS, favor HCC 
 
 
 
(tentative tumor staging for HCC)
