Findings:  
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Multiple early enhancement and early washout nodules (some of them contains internal calcifications) in right lobe of liver , up to 7.0 cm at S5-8 liver, favor HCCs. 
 
A 1.15 cm calcified nodule in upper pole of spleen , nature to be determined . 
 
A 1.58 cm splenic cyst. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Left renal cysts .    
 
Calcifications in the expected site of pancreatic pancreatic body. 
 
Absence of pancreatic tail and distal pancreatic body, fatty replacement or post OP change? 
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
 
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
No definite bony destruction.  
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
Mesenteirc fat stranding with multipe small pelvic LNs . 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
