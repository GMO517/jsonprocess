Findings: 
 
Tortousity of abdominal aorta with wall calcifications. 
 
Focal centrolobular nodules at LLL, more favor inflammation process. 
 
Plate atelectasis at LLL.  
 
Lobulated contour with intrahepatic vessels tortous change, compatible with liver cirrhosis. 
 
3 liver masses at S3 (3.0 cm),  and S6 (1.26 cm) with early enhanced and early wash-out pattern , favor HCCs. 
 
Patency of the portal veins no thrombus was found. 
 
Moderate splenomegaly. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Unremarkable of gallbladder. 
 
No definite occupying lesion in pancreas and spleen. 
 
No ascites. 
 
Patency of appendix. 
 
No hydronephrosis. 
 
Bil. renal cysts (〈 12.1 mm). 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs. 
 
Bladder base indentation, prostate enlargement is considered. 
 
Heterogenous enhancement with calcification of prostate gland.   
 
Degenerative change of lumbar spine with spurs formation and scoliosis   
 
Small round laminated radiopaque density in the pelvic cavity due to phlebolith.  
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Three liver masses at S3 (3.0 cm)and S6 (1.8, 0.65 cm) with early enhanced and   early wash-out pattern ,favor HCCs. 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with spelnomegaly. 
 
* Focal centrolobular nodules at LLL, more favor inflammation process. 
 
* Heterogenous enhancement with calcification of prostate gland, suggest follow-up.
