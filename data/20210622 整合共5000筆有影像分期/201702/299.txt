Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A 2.1cm nodule in S6 liver with early enhance and washout, favor HCC 
 
A 8.4mm nodule in S3 liver with early enhance and isodense in late 
 
 phase, due to hemangioma or small HCC? but not seen in prior Liver CT 
 
 on 20111228 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Tiny gallstone, not well distension of 
 
 GB 
 
Bilateral small renal cysts 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S6 liver tumor(2.1cm), favor HCC 
 
3.Small enhance nodule in S3 liver(8mm), suspect HCC 
 
4.Renal cysts
