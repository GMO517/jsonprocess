Findings:  
 
Two small subpleural nodules (3-5mm) in left basal lung 
 
Multiple hypdonse and heterogeneously enhanced nodules masses (5-80mm) in right liver, especially S5-6, and a few small nodule in left liver 
 
No definite biliary tree dilatation  . 
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen 
 
Mildly dilated P-duct but no definite pancreatic mass is seen 
 
One well enhanced nodule (1cm) anterior to left diaphragmatic crus 
 
Multiple bil. renal csyts (4-19mm) 
 
No hydronephrosis  
 
Multiple prominent intercavoaortic and left paraaortic LNs 
 
No dilated ureters 
 
Minimal ascites 
 
No focal bowel dilatation (but subtle hollow organ tumor or small mucosal lesion may not be well detected on conventional abdominal CT)  
 
Degenerative change of lumbar spine with spurs formation  
 
Enlarged prostate gland 
 
 
 
Impression 
 
1. Two small subpleural nodules (3-5mm) in left basal lung. Metastasis? 
 
2. Multiple hypdonse and heterogeneously enhanced nodules masses both lobes, more in right lobe. Nature? Metastsis or primary malignant liver tumors? 
 
3. One well enhanced nodule (1cm) anterior to left diaphragmatic crus 
 
4. Enlarged prostate gland
