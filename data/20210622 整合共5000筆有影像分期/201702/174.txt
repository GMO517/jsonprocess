Findings: 
 
 
 
Calcification of coronary artery at risk of coronary artery disease.    
 
Consolidation of left lower lung with pleural effusion 
 
Bilateral lower and right middle lung nodules(0.5~0.9cm) 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Heterogeneous enhancing tumor with central necrosis over S4(8.8cm),S1(6.5cm),LLS(16.5cm), S6/7(8.9cm), S7(5.4cm,3.3cm) 
 
Multiple nodule and mass over RUQ peritoneum and omentum suggest tumor seeding and carcinomatosis 
 
Suspect S4 tumor ruptured with hemoperitoneum 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
 
Bilateral renal stones 
 
Enlarged common hepatic artery LN. 
 
Massive ascites  
 
A 2.3cm osteolytic lesion over L3 vertebrae and right side pedicle with pathological compression fracture  
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
1.Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
2.Multiple liver enhancing tumor favor HCCs with lung and LNs metastasis, peritoneal seeding and/or carcinomatosis. S/P TAE with lipiodol stasis in LLS tumor 
 
3.Favor recent tumor ruptured of S4 tumor with hemoperitoneum, no evidence of active bleeding noted. 
 
4.L3 osteolytic lesio with pathological fracture, favor bone metastasis
