Findings:   
 
Calcified plaques at RCA and LAD with increased risk of CAD. 
LLL pulmonary nodule (0.48cm) or focal atelectasis over LLL? 
Unremarkable study of pancrease. 
Lobulated liver contour suggestiong liver cirrhosis. 
Splenomegaly. 
S4 hepatic cyst about 0.9cm 
One 3.5x2.6x2.1cm tumor with early enhancement and washout pattern in S7 liver, favor hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Patency of portal vein. 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Mild gallbladder wall thickening without distention or gallstone. 
No definite adrenal mass. 
No definite hydronephrosis.

IMP: 
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  
* One 3.5x2.6x2.1cm tumor in S7 liver, favor HCC. 
* LLL pulmonary nodule (0.48cm) or focal atelectasis over LLL? 
* Mild wall thickening of collapsed gallbladder.
