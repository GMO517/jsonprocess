● For apply NHI Target or immunotheropy 
●CR：Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancementin all target lesions. 
○PR：At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking asreference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. 
○SD：Any cases that do not qualify for either partial responseor progressive disease. 
○PD：An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diametersof viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference thesmallest sum of the diameters of viable enhancing) targetlesions recorded since treatment started.
