Findings:  
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lungs.  
A huge heterogenously enhanced mass (16.2x14.2x10.3 cm) with central necrosis in right lobe of liver, causing downward displacement of right kidney, favoring HCCs. 
Extracapsular peritoneum invasion is noted 
Small hepatic cysts in bilobar liver. 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
Left renal cysts (up to 1.0 cm).  
Patency of PVs and HVs.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No definite bony destruction.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP: * Right lobe liver huge tumors with perihepatic peritoneum invasion, favoring viable HCCs.
