Findings: 
Focal atelectasis with fibrotic bands over bilateral LLs 
Pulmonary infiltration in RML, left lingular, bilateral LLs 
Calcification of coronary arteries, at the risk of CAD.  
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Early enhanced and washout mass (9.4x8.1cm) in S8 liver, favoring HCC 
Small low attenuation lesions in LLS and S6 of liver may be small liver cysts 
Rim enhanced nodule (2.1cm) in left paraaortic region, nature? 
Ascites over right subphrenic region 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder. 
Patency of portal vein. 
Mild thickening of left adrenal gland 
Bilateral renal cysts 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
No abnormal free air in the abdomen. 
Postoperative change of rectum 
S/P transpedicle screws fixation of L2 3 4 5 S1  
S/P vertebroplasty for compression fracture of T12 
Degenerative change of thoracic and lumbar spine with spurs formation and scoliosis.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
