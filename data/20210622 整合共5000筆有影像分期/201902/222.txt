Findings: 
No definite pulmonary nodules. 
Multiple early enhanced and early washout hepatic tumors in bilobar of the liver, up to 10.7 x 10 cm in S4-8 region, compatible with HCCs. 
Splenomegaly. 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Gallstones. 
Bilateral renal cysts. 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys.  
Patency of bil. ureters.  
Multiple small paravertebral and retroperitoneal LNs.  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen.  
 
 
IMP:  
* HCCs in bilobar of the liver, up to 10.7 x 10 cm in S4-8 region with right and left portal vein compression. 
* Multiple small paravertebral and retroperitoneal LNs, favoring metastasis 
* Gallstones.
