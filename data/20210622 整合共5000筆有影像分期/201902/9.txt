Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Ill-defined early enhanced liver masses in S4 (3.5cm) and S8 (1.7cm) with early washout, favor HCCs 
Thrombosis of the portal veins r/o tumor invasion 
Marked splenomegaly and varices 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
Mild ascites 
No right hydronephrosis 
s/p left nephrectomy, focal post stranding and small fluid collection (2.8cm) 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly, varices and ascites 
Infiltrated early enhanced liver tumors in S4 and S8 with portal thrombosis 
s/p left nephrectomy, focal post stranding and small fluid collection (2.8cm)
