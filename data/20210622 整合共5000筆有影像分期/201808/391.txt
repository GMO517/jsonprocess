Imaging  Findings: 
Mild lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
A 5mm cyst in S4 liver 
A lobulated mass(3.7cm) with early enhance and early washout noted in S4 liver, favoring HCC. 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Normal gallbladder without stone. 
Tiny right renal stone 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Impression:  
* Liver cirrhosis. 
* Favoring HCC(3.7cm) in S4 liver.
