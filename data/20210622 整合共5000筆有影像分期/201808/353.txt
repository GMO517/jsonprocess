Findings: 
 
Patch consolidation over RLL. 
Multiple early enhancing and early washout masses/nodules noted in bil. lobes of liver, the largest one 11.7cm over S5/6 with central necrosis. 
Hilar invasion by the tumors with diffuse dilatation of bil. IHDs and main PV invasion. 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Non-visualization of gallbladder  
Patency of bil. portal veins 
Enlarged LNs(size upto 2.5cm) in hilar and hepatoduodenal regions.   
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
Nasogastric tube in place  . 
 
IMP: 
* Favoring multiple HCCs in bil. lobes of liver, the largest one 11.7cm over S5/6 with central necrosis. 
* Hilar invasion by the tumors with diffuse dilatation of bil. IHDs and main PV invasion. 
* Metastatic LNs(size upto 2.5cm) in hilar and hepatoduodenal regions.
