IMP: 
 
1.Liver cirrhosis  
2.LLS liver poor enhancing mass (4cm) and left perihilar infiltrative mass. DDX: HCCs, cholangiocarcinoma.  
3.Hepatic hilar enhancing mass, exophytic of the perihilar liver mass or enlarged portal hepatis LNs  
4.Mark LLS IHDs dilatation with IHD stones, maybe due to perihilar mass compression/invasion 
5.Mark gallbladder wall thickening with increase enhancement, can not excluded malignancy 
6.Left subphrenic hypodens lesion (3.9cm) with peripheral enhancement , abscess ?
