Findings: 
Mild bil. lower lung infiltration and pleural effusion 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple right liver nodular masses with poor enhancement, the biggest in S8 up to 9x11cm s/p treatment? 
Diffuse thrombosis of the portal veins including MPV 
No splenomegaly but varices noted 
Mild ascites 
Focal right IHD dilatation around the tumor may due to tumor invasion 
Multiple gallstones 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis and gastric varices with mild ascites 
Multiple right liver nodular tumors (biggest 9x11cm) with portal thrombosis and focal rigth IHD dilatation
