Findings: 
RLL lung infiltration and nodular lesions over base or hemidiapgragm r/o metastasis 
Multiple peritoneal seeding lesions over right anterior liver surface and subphrenic region 
Several tiny liver cysts in right lobe 〈 1cm 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
s/p right hemicolectomy 
Multiple mesenteric nodular lesions up to 2.0cm with strandings  
No hydronephrosis, bil. renal cysts up to 1.6cm 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
Mild ascites 
Large cystic mass about 7x8x9cm r/o ovarian cystic tumor, urinary bladder structure is less likely 
The urinary bladder is not distended for assessment 
Prominent pre-rectal irregular soft tissue mass about 6x11cm may be also peritoneal seeding masses 
IMP: 
s/p right hemicolectomy 
Diffuse mesenteric and peritoneal seeding nodular masses, favor carcinomatosis 
Large cystic mass about 7x8x9cm in pelvis r/o ovarian cystic tumor?
