Findings: 
Multiple bil. pulmonary nodules over visualized lower lobes due to lung metastasis 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Huge enhanced right liver mass about 12x15cm with right subcapsular perihepatic hematoma due to tumor rupture 
Multiple enhanced seeding nodules in right subphrenic space, the biggest up to 4cm 
Obliteration of right portal veins due to tumor invasion 
Mild splenomegaly 
Marked ascites and another diffuse peritoneal seeding nodules also noted 
No definite biliary dilatation 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No hydronephrosis but tiny left renal stone noted 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
Huge right liver tumor mass (12x15cm) favor HCC with rupture 
Peritoneal carcinomatosis with diffuse seeding tumor nodules 
Lung metastasis with bil. lung nodules
