Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
Gallstones (up to 1.7 cm) without definite wall-thickening of gallbladder.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
A huge early enhancement and early washout mass (15.3x10.2x13.8 cm) in right lobe of liver with suspicious of RAPV 
Patency of MPV and LPV 
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
No definite hydronephrosis  
Left renal cysts (up to 2.0 cm). 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
No definite bony destruction.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.   
 
IMP: * Liver cirrhosis with gallstones. 
     * Right lobe liver huge HCC with suspicious invasion of RAPV
