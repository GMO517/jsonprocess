Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
Multiple faint early enhanced liver nodules in LLS (2.0cm), S6-7 (2.5cm) and S8 (1.4cm) with equivocal hypodense change at late phase, can not exclude HCCs 
Another two hypodense lesions in S5 (1.0cm) and S5-6 (1.3cm) without evident enahncement r/o regenerative nodules 
Calcified spots in S4 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, s/p cholecystectomy 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis but tiny left renal stones noted 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
Multiple faint early enhanced liver nodules in LLS (2.0cm), S6-7 (2.5cm) and S8 (1.4cm), suspicious HCCs 
 
(tentative tumor staging for HCCs without pathlogy)
