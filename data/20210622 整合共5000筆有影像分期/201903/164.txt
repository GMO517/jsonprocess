Findings: 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
A newfound 2.2 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S4 liver, favoring viable HCC 
Small liver cysts about 1.0 & 1.0 cm in S4 liver 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
