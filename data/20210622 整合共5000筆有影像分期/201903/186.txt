Imaging  Findings: 
 
Mild infiltration in RLL 
 
A mass (2.7X2.2X2cm) in S6-7 liver near surface, with early enhance 
 
 and early washout, favor HCC 
 
A 1.2cm cyst in LLS liver 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
Collapsed gallbladder with tiny stone, no dilatation of biliary tree 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
A calcify plaque(1.9X0.4cm) locate in dependent part of urinary bladder 
 
 may due to stone 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.S6-7 liver tumor(2.7cm), favor HCC 
 
2.A 1.2cm cyst in LLS liver 
 
3.Tiny gallstone, poor distension of GB 
 
4.A calcify plaque(1.9X0.4cm) locate in dependent part of urinary bladder 
 
 may due to stone
