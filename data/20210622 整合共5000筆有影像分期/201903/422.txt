Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Multiple early enhancement and early washout nodules and poorly defined infiltrating tumors in bilateral lobes of liver (predominant in right lobe of liver) with tumor throbosis in RPV  
Patency of MPV and LPV 
Splenomegaly  
Small LNs noted over gastrohepatic ligament 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
Gallstones 
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
No definite bony destruction.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP:  
* Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly with gallstones 
* Favoring multiple viable HCCs and extensive infiltrating tumors in bilobar liver with tumor thrombosis in RPV, viable tumors predominant in right lobe of liver.
