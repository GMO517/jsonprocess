An 2.5cm mass in S3 liver near surface with mild early enhance and  
 
early washout, favor HCC 
 
A 0.6cm hypodense nodule in S7 liver without early enhancement, 
 
 suspect small cyst or regenerative nodule

Bilateral small size kidneys, no obstruction over left side 
 
Tiny stone in left renal lower calyx 
 
Mural wall thickening right M/3 ureter and soft tissue lesion in  
 
right D/3 ureter causing hydroureter and right severe hydronephrosis 
 
 with paper thin cortex, suspicious uroepithelial tumor of right  
 
ureter

2.S3 liver mass (2.5cm) favor HCC 
 
3.S7 nodule may be cyst or regenerative nodule 
 
4.Suspicious uroepithelial tumor of right M/3 and D/3 ureter causing 
 
 right obstrutive uropathy 
 
5.S/P right hemicolectomy
