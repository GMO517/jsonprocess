Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Three cysts in S8, S4 and LLS liver, upto 3.3cm 
 
A 5.5cm mass in S7-8 liver early enhance and washout, favor HCC 
 
The tumor compress to RHV 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
S/P right nephrectomy, residual soft tissue density over the right 
 
 renal vessels region, no obvious interval change 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Ventral hernia with omentral herniation over anterior abdominal wall 
 
 at umbilicus level(2.3cm defect) 
 
Circumferential mural thickening over sigmoid colon with mild pericolonic 
 
 stranding can't exclude colon tumor 
 
Small pericolonic regional LN 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  .
