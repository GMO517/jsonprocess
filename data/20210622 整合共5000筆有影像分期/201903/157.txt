Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Patency of portal vein.  
A 1.7 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S3 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
Hepatic cyst at S7 liver (1.2 cm)  
Gallstones in gallbladder (up to 0.5 cm) without definite GB wall-thickening  
No definite focal mass in pancreas and spleen.  
Right renal fatty nodule (1.9 cm), maybe due to renal hamartoma. 
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the left with size of 7.0 cm .  
No definite hydronephrosis  
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
IMP:  
* Liver cirrhosis with gallstones 
* A 1.7 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S3 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
* Right renal hamartoma
