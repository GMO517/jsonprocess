Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple early enhancing liver nodules in S7-8 with early washout, the biggest about 3.6cm, favor HCCs 
 
Patent portal veins but suspected tumor invasion the upper branch of RPV 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
Multiple (at least three, biggest up to 3.6cm) early enhanced liver nodules in S7-8, favor HCCs
