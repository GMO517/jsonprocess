Findings:  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule noted in visualized field.  
Mild pulmonary infiltration in bilateral lower lung fields.  
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
Splenomegaly  
Multiple early enhancement and early washout nodules in LLS (14.1 mm), S4 (25.2 mm) , S5 (14.1 mm) and S7 (12.7 mm), favoring viable HCCs 
Presence of perigastric varices.
