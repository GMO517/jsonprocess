 
Findings:   
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
About 6.74*6.04cm exophytic heterogeneous density mass from pancreatic head. 
Infiltrative tumor at S5-6 (12.9cm) with heterogeneous enhancement; several nodules in both lobes of liver.  
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
Unremarkable gallbladder; no biliary tree dilatation. 
Patency of portal vein. 
No definite adrenal mass. 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
Enlarged lymph nodes at periceliac, hilar and retrocaval (1.6cm) region. 
No abnormal fluid collection or free air in the abdomen.  
No definite bone destruction. 
 
IMP: 
* About 6.74*6.04cm exophytic heterogeneous density mass from pancreatic head; suspicous for pancreatic cancer. 
* S5-6 infiltrative tumor (12.9cm) and several nodules in both lobes of liver, favoring metastasis 
* Enlarged lymph nodes at periceliac, hilar and retrocaval region, some with necrotic change.
