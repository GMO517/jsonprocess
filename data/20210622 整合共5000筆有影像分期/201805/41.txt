Imaging  Findings: 
Focal atelectasis over RLL 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
Multiple nodules in both lobes of liver, some with early enhancement and 
 some with early washout, favor HCCs 
An exophytic tumor with indistinguishable border measure about 5.5X5X6.1cm 
 in S6 of liver with suspicious minor tumor bleeding 
Favor local invasion of S6 tumor to adjacent peritoneal wall 
No splenomegaly 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
No definite obstructive uropathy  . 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
Massive ascites with intermediate density suspicious turbid ascites nor 
 due to prior hemoperitoneum 
 
Impression:  
1.Liver cirrhosis 
2.Favor multiple HCCs in both lobes of liver, an exophytic S6 tumor(6.1cm) 
 may invade adjacent peritoneal wall and complicated with tumor rupture and 
 minor tumor bleeding 
3.Turbid ascites nor due to prior hemoperitoneum
