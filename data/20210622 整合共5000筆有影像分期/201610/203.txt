Findings: 
 
Lobulated and fatty change of liver compatible with chronic liver parenchymal disease 
 
Multiple tiny liver cysts in bil. lobes 
 
One enhanced liver nodule about 3.1cm in S7-8 may be hemangioma, but progression in size noted 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstone about 1.0cm noted
