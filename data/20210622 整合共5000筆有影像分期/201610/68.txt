Findings: 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visualized bil. lower lungfields 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with cirrhotic change 
 
Large infiltrative enhancing mass (10x13cm) in right liver, consistent with HCC 
 
Multiple smaller liver nodulses in bil. lobes due to HCCs 
 
Tumor infiltration and occlusion of RHV and IVC extending to right atrium (4.2x4cm) 
 
Diffuse tumor thrombosis of right & left PV, MPV down to splenomesenteric junction, minimally extending to branching point of SMV and IMV 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Contracted gallbladder; no biliary tree dilatation 
 
Unremarkable pancreas and bil. adrenal glands 
 
Minimal abdomen and pelvic ascites 
 
Several enlarged periportal LNs and aortocaval LN(up to 1.4cm) 
 
Degenerative change of thoracolumbar spine 
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
IMP: 
 
 * Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
 
 * Multiple HCCs in bil. lobes, the biggest about 10x13cm over right lobe 
 
 * Tumor infiltration and occlusion of RHV, IVC, into right atrium; diffuse portal thrombosis down to splenomesenteric junction 
 
 * Several periportal LNs and enlarged aortocaval LN (up to 1.4cm)
