Imaging  Findings: 
 
Focal atelectasis over medial segment of RML 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A 1cm cyst in S4 liver 
 
About nodules and mass with early enhance and washout in S6(4.9cm), 
 
 S4(0.83cm), S3(5.9cm,1.27cm) of liver, favor HCC

No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Gallstones, contracted GB 
 
Multiple enlarge LNs around gastrohepatic, periceliac, CHA, portocaval, 
 
 periceliac, SMA root, aortocaval, paraaortic, retrocrural regions 
 
Small size of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Small left renal cyst 
 
Subtle mucosal lesion or tumor of colon could not be well detected by  
 
abdominal CT study

Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly; ascites 
 
2.Favor HCCs in S6(4.9cm), S4(0.83cm), S3(5.9cm,1.27cm) of liver 
 
3.Gallstones 
 
4.Multiple enlarge LNs around gastrohepatic, periceliac, CHA, portocaval, 
 
 periceliac, SMA root, aortocaval, paraaortic, retrocrural regions,favor 
 
 metastasis LNs
