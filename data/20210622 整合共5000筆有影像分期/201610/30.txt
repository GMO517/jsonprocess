Findings: 
 
Interstitial infiltrates in visualized bil. lower lungfields  
 
Consolidation with air bronchogram in the RLL 
 
Coarse echotexture of liver compatible with chronic liver parenchymal disease 
 
Large heterogeneous enhancing infiltrative mass (16.2cm) involving bilobar liver with some calcification 
 
Occlusion and tumor infiltration of the right and left PV, IVC, and some extension into right atrium 
 
Filling defect in left pulmonary artery due to embolism 
 
Unremarkable spleen with no focal lesion 
 
Moderate ascites 
 
Unremarkable pancreas and bil. adrenal glands 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, contracted GB

IMP: 
 
* Chronic liver parenchymal disease withy splenomegaly and ascites 
 
* Multiple infiltrative enhanced liver tumors in bil. lobes (the biggest 16.2cm), compatible with HCCs 
 
* Tumor invasion and occlusion of the right & left PV, IVC, extension into right atrium and also left pulmonary embolism
