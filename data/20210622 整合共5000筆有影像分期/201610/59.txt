Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Two hypodense liver masses in S2 (2.4x3.9cm) and S3-4 (3.6x5.1cm), another small nodule about 1.2cm in S3, all with early enahncement and early washout, favor HCCs 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Suspect small contracted spleen about 1.8x4.0cm, accessary spleen? 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, multiple gallstones and ectatic CHD= 1.0cm 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis but right renal stone about 1.2cm noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
s/p hysterectomy 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis, small contracted spleen 
 
Multiple gallstones 
 
Multiple early enhance liver tumors in S2, S3 and S3-4, favor HCCs
