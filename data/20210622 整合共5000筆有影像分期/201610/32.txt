Findings: 
 
Mild decreased attenuation of liver parenchyma compatible with fatty change  
 
No obvious focal liver nodule 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Gallstone (0.9cm), no biliary tree dilatation 
 
Unremarkable pancreas, spleen and bil. adrenal glands; no focal lesion 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
Tiny right renal stone (0.3cm) 
 
Right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with suspicious ureteral tumor mass about 1.5x2.4cm 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
Calcified pelvic LNs (0.9cm, 0.6cm) 
 
Irregular wall thickening of the urinary bladder with internal soft tissue masses about 2.3 to 4.5cm may be bladder tumors 
 
Several enlarged LNs over bil. pelvis up to 2.1cm r/o metastasis 
 
IMP:
