Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
One early enhanced liver nodular mass in LLS about 4.1cm with early washout 
 
Another two enhanced liver nodules in S7 about 4.2cm and S8 about 1.6cm 
 
Tumor invasion to the RHV 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly 
 
Three enhanced liver nodules in LLS (4.1cm), S7 (4.2cm) and S8 (1.6cm), favor HCCs 
 
Obliterated RHV may be due to tumor invasion
