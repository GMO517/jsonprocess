Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
Multiple early enhancing liver nodules in bil. lobes, the biggest about 7.5cm in S6, early washout of the lesions and favoring HCCs 
 
Diffuse portal thrombosis with portal occlusion 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
Mild ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis but left renal stone noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly and ascites 
 
Favoring multiple HCCs in bil. lobes with portal thrombosis
