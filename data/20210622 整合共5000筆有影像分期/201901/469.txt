Findings: 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
Numerous hypodense liver nodules in both lobes with mild enhancement, biggest up to 3.6cm, favoring metastasis 
Another persistent enhanced live rnodule about 3.0cm in S4 may be hemangioma 
Patency of the portal veins, several periportal LNs up to 1.1cm 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
One ill-defined hypodense pancreatic mass up to 2.7cm with dilated P-duct (0.8cm) r/o malignancy 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
Enlarged prostate may due to hypertrophy 
No evident bony destruction 
IMP: 
Favoring pancreatic cancer with peripancreatic LN and liver metastasis 
One persistent enhanced live rnodule about 3.0cm in S4 may be hemangioma
