Findings: 
Relative low density of liver is compatible with fatty liver  
Multiple hypodense liver nodules (up to 3.6cm) with mild enhancement, favor liver metastasis 
Patency of the portal veins 
Mild splenomegaly 
No ascites 
No definite biliary dilatation, but gallstones are noted 
Ill-defined pancreatic mass about 3.8x5.1cm with peripancreatic infiltration and stranding around celiac trunk, obliterated splenomesenteric junction due to tumor invasion, several enlarged LNs up to 1.3cm 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
No hydronephrosis 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
IMP: 
Multiple gallstones 
Multiple mildly enhanced liver nodules, favor liver metastasis 
Pancreatic cancer with perifocal invasion and enlarged LNs
