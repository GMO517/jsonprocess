Findings: 
 
Calcification of right coronary artery  
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver, compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
A 0.5 cm calcified granuloma in S6. 
 
Equivocal early enhancing nodules with early washout in S2 liver with size 2cm , suspecting hepatocellular carcinoma 
 
Several small non enhancing nodules in right liver all size 〈0.5 cm, maybe cysts? 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
No definite hydronephrosis. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
No definite bone destruction. 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT. 
 
Degenerative change of lumbar spine with spurs formation  
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
1. Suspecting HCC in S2 liver (2cm); Tentative staging T1Nx in this study 
 
2. Probably multiple right liver cysts and calcified granuloma in S6 
 
3. Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
4. Calcification of right coronary artery
