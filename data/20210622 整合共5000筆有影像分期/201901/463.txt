Findings:  
 
Mild pulmonary infiltration in right lower lung and left ligular lobe  
A 13.2x10x8.5 cm early enhancement and early washout tumor in S5-6 liver with central necrosis, compatible with HCCs 
Equivocal obliteration of MHV, suspicious invasion of MHV 
Another two small early washout daughter nodules in S6 liver (1.1 cm & 1.2 cm), favoring HCCs. 
Two 0.6 cm & 1.2 cm hypodense nodules in the spleen 
Patency of portal vein.  
Enlarged prostate with calcifications.  
Gallstones in gallbladder (up to 1.6 cm) without definite GB wall-thickening  
Focal IHD dilatation in S2 liver. 
No definite focal mass in pancreas   
A 3.8 cm poorly defined heterogenously enhanced nodular mass in left kidney 
Bilateral renal cysts, the biggest on the left with size of 1.0 cm .  
Normal function and contour of right kidney.  
Patency of right ureter.  
No definite adrenal nodule.  
A 4 cm outpouching lesion at right urinary bladder wall, due to bladder diverticulum . 
Diffuse atherosclerotic change of visualized vessels.  
Enlarged prostate with calcifications.  
S/P sigmoid colectomy with anastomosis 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.
