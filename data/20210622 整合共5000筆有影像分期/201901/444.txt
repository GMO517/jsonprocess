Findings:  
 
 
 
Two calcified pulmonary nodule in LLL (5.7 mm) and left ligular lobe (3.5 mm), favoring granulomas. 
 
Another tiny pulmonary nodule in LLL (4.9 mm) 
 
A 2.3 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S8 liver, favoring viable HCC. 
 
Tiny hepatic cysts at the liver. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
Unremarkable gallbladder without stone.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
No definite adrenal nodule.  
 
Normal function and contour of both kidneys.  
 
Patency of bilateral ureters.  
 
No definite retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  
 
No fluid collection in abdomen.  
 
Wall-thickening of non-fully expanded urinary bladder, maybe due to chronic cystitis. 
 
Kindly note that subtle mucosal lesion could not be well evaluated on routine CT.  
 
 
 
IMP: * Another tiny pulmonary nodule in LLL (4.9 mm) 
 
     * A 2.3 cm early enhancement and early washout nodule in S8 liver, favoring viable HCC.
