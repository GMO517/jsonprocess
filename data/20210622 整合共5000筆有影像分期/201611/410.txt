Findings: 
 
Bronchiectasis and volume shrinkage of RML and left lingual lobe of bilateral lungs. 
 
Focal pleural thickening over RML. 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
1.0cm early enhancing nodule in S7 of liver with early wash-out, favoring HCC. Not present on previous study on 2016/01/16. 
 
Multiple hepatic cysts in right lobe and S1 of liver up to 1.5cm. 
 
Mild IHDs dilatation. 
 
Multiple tiny gallbladder stones. 
 
Gallbladder wall thickening, but gallbladder is not distended. 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas. 
 
Marked splenomegaly. 
 
No focal adrenal mass 
 
Several small but prominent liver hilar lymph nodes. 
 
Moderate amount of ascites. 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy   
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites 
 
* Early enhancing and wash-out nodule in S7 of liver. Favoring HCC. 
 
* Bronchiectasis and volume shrinkage of RML and left lingual lobe. May be due to NTM. 
 
* Gallbladder stones.
