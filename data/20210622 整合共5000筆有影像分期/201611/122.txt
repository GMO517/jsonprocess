Findings: 
 
Relative hypodense change of the liver parenchyma due to fatty change 
 
An equivocal hypodense lesion in S5 about 1.5cm but not to be well indentfied without enhanced study 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, normal GB 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No definite obstructive uropathy but tiny renal stones noted 
 
It can not well dectect any isodense lesion without IV contrast study 
 
IMP:  
 
Chronic liver parenchymal disease with fatty change and splenomegaly 
 
An equivocal hypodense lesion in S5 about 1.5cm but not to be well indentfied 
 
Multiple bil. renal caliceal stones, no hydronephrosis
