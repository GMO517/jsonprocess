Imaging  Findings: 
 
Relative low density of liver with good visualization of venous  
 
system compatible with fatty liver, mark progressive change 
 
 compare with prior abdomen CT study on 20151109 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Multiple early enhance nodules found in both lobes of liver, 
 
 S2(4.9,9.5,6.4mm), S4(1.55cm), S5-8(7.2mm), S5(8.8mm) & S6(1.92cm),  
 
 those nodules were not found in prior abdomen CT on 20151109, favor 
 
 new growth nodules or tumors 
 
Splenomegaly 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
Recanalization of umbilical vein 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No obvious gallstone, dilatation of CBD=1.42cm, no obvious CBD stone 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly; UV(+) 
 
2.Severe fatty change of liver and progression compare with prior study 
 
3.Multiple bilobar enhance nodules suspicious for HCCs, upto 1.9cm 
 
*(most of the liver nodules may be shown hyperdense to liver parenchymal 
 
 in case of severe fatty change of liver in CT study, the dynamic enhancement  
 
 may be more better in MRI study*) 
 
4.Dilatation of CBD=1.42cm
