Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
One early enhanced liver nodule about 1.7cm in S7 with early washout, favor HCC 
 
Another poor enhanced liver nodule about 1.3cm in high S7 with early washout, also suspected HCC, suggest further check-up 
 
Multiple tiny hypodense lesions in S3, S4, S5 and S6 without enhancement up to 1.0cm, may be cysts 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, but tiny gallstones noted 
 
Unremarkable change of the pancreas 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly 
 
One early enahnced liver nodule in S7 about 1.7cm may be HCC 
 
Another suspected HCC in S7 about 1.3cm also noted 
 
Favor multiple small liver cysts in bil. lobes
