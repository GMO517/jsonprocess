Findings: 
 
 
 
Pulmonary mild infiltration in left lingular segment, RML and right lower lobe with small atelectasis.  
 
Calcification over mitral valve.  
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis.  
 
Splenomegaly   
 
A 4.0 cm early enhancement and early wash out lesion in S8 liver. 
 
A few small (All〈 0.5 cm) liver cysts in S4 and S2 liver. 
 
Small LNs (all〈 1.1 cm in short axial diameter) in peripancreatic and periportal regions. 
 
Patency of portal vein.  
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Muletiple stones (all〈 0.7 cm in size) in gall bladder. 
 
Bil. renal cysts, the largest one about 2.9 cm in right kidney. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs.
