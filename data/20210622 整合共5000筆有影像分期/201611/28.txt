      Report: Triphasic CT study of liver with a total of 330 images in 5mm spacing of liver and delayed scan of the rest of abdomen shows:  
 
(this study is not optimal for chest organs evaluation):  
 
Mucoal lesion of GI tract cannot be well evaluated in this routine abdominal CT study due to no optimal preparation and no good expansion of the whole GI tract which may be better assessed by scope or barium study. 
 
About 6cm lobualted enhancing mass without persisting tumor stain at S5 of liver. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation.  
 
Patency of portal veins.  
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs.  
 
No apparent hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  
 
No abnormal fluid collection in peritoneal cavity.  
 
Suspicious tiny nodule in RLL.
