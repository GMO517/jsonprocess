 
Imaging  Findings: 
 
A 2.07cm nodule in S6 liver with early enhance and early washout, 
 
favor HCC 
 
Three early enhance nodules in S4(0.83cm),and S6(0.63cm,0.72cm)  
 
 of liver, with persist enhance in late phase, suspect hemangioma 
 
A 0.89cm focal enhance lesion in LLS of liver and nearly isodense  
 
in late phase 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
Bilateral small renal calyx stone 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
Calcification over prostate gland 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.S6 enhance liver mass(2.07cm), favor HCC 
 
2.Three small enhance nodules in S4 and S6 liver, suspect hemangioma or HCC 
 
3.Focal enhance lesion in LLS of liver near surface, due to focal AP shunt?
