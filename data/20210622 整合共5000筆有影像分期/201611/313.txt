Findings: 
 
Lobulated and uneven contour of liver is compatible with liver cirrhosis 
 
s/p partial right hepatectomy (S6-7) 
 
No obvious focal liver nodule 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
Mild splenomegaly 
 
No ascites 
 
No definite biliary dilatation, s/p cholecystectomy 
 
Focal nodular mass over pancreatic body about 3.4cm with calcified spot and distal P-duct dilatation, suspicious pancreatic tumor 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  
 
No hydronephrosis but tiny right renal stone noted 
 
No evident enlarged retroperitoneal LNs 
 
IMP: 
 
Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly 
 
s/p partial right hepatectomy and cholecystectomy 
 
No evident focal recurrent liver mass  
 
Suspicious pancreatic body tumor about 3.4cm, suggest further study
