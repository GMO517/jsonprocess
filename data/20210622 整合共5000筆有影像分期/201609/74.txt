Findings: 
 
 
 
Patch consoldiation over RLL 
 
Mild right pleural effusion. 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Splenomegaly   
 
An ill-defined mass(2.6cm) with mildly early enhancing and early washout noted in LLS liver, favoring HCC 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  . 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Partial mural thrombosis over left PV and extended into upper main PV. 
 
Patency of right and main portal vein   
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
Massive ascites. 
 
Increasing fatty stranding over mesenteric region. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites. 
 
* Favoring HCC(2.6cm) in LLS liver. 
 
* Partial mural thrombosis over left PV and extended into upper main PV, tumoral thrombosis?
