Findings: 
 
Patchy infiltrates in left lower lungfield 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Splenomegaly  
 
Multiple non-enhancing nodules in both lobes of the liver (〈1cm) 
 
Non-enhancing nodule in S6/7 (1.9cm), may favor HCC  
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen .

Impression: 
 
* Liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly 
 
* Multiple non-enhancing nodules in both lobes of the liver (〈1cm), may be regenerative nodules 
 
* Non-enhancing nodule in S6/7 (1.9cm), may favor HCC (review of MRI 20160701 with cold spot in HBP) 
 
* Left kidney harmatoma(3.7cm) 
 
* Non-obstructive bil. renal stones 
 
* Gallstone, no biliary dilatation
