       Report: Brief Hx: A 49 y/o male with liver tumor  
 
 
 
CT of the liver with pre-contrast & triphasic contrast enhancement studies show:   
 
Techniques:  
 
From lower chest to liver inferior edge in 5-mm contiguous section  
 
Contrast agent  injected at 2ml/sec, 30 sec after initiation of injection, starting arterial phase scan; portal phase scan performed in 20 sec after the end of the arterial phase scan; and venous phase scan began in 20 sec after the end of portal phase scan 
 
 
 
Findings: 
 
 
 
No definite pulmonary nodule in visual field. 
 
Mild lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver parenchymal disease. 
 
An early enhancing and early washout tumor(2.2cm) noted in S2 liver, favoring HCC. 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the spleen and pancreas. 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. 
 
Unremarkable study of gallbladder  
 
Patency of portal vein   
 
Normal function and contour of bil. kidneys and no definite obstructive uropathy. 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen. 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
* Liver parenchymal disease. 
 
* Favoring HCC(2.2cm) in S2 liver.
