Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
Multiple small low attenuated nodules (〈1.26cm)in bil. lobes of  
 
the liver may be due to regenerative nodules 
 
Three small nodules with early enhancement in S5(7.3mm), S6(8.3mm)  
 
and S8(1.14cm) of liver 
 
No definite biliary dilatation  
 
Prominent esophageal and gastric varices; presence of gastrorenal  
 
shunt 
 
Patency of the portal veins 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs   
 
No definite obstructive uropathy 
 
Bilateral renal cysts(1.1cm) 
 
Marked splenomegaly     
 
No ascites 
 
 
 
IMP: 
 
1.Decompensatory liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly; esophageal and 
 
 gastric varices; gastrorenal shunt 
 
2.Multiple small liver nodules in bil. lobes, may due to regenerative 
 
 nodules 
 
3.Three small nodules with early enhancement in S5(7.3mm), S6(8.3mm)  
 
and S8(1.14cm) of liver, suspect small HCCs
