Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A mass in S3 liver(3.1X2.7X2.9cm) with early enhance and early washout, 
 
 favor HCC 
 
Two nodules in S2-3(1.3cm) and S6(0.5cm) of liver with early enhance 
 
 and persist enhance during late phase, favor hemangioma 
 
Two cysts in S1 and LLS liver (〈1.2cm) 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
S/P cholecystectomy, dilatation of CHD=1.59cm 
 
No definite obstructive uropathy  .
