Imaging  Findings: 
 
Lobulated contour of liver compatible with liver cirrhosis  . 
 
A mild lobulated mass (3.16cm) in S5 of liver with early enhance  
 
and early washout, favor HCC 
 
A 8.5mm early enhance nodule in S5 liver near surface 
 
A 8.2mm hypodense or early washout nodule in S2-4 liver during  
 
portal and venous phase 
 
A 5mm cyst in S7-8 liver 
 
Patent MPV and branches, no evidence of thrombosis 
 
No definite space occupying lesion in the pancreas and spleen . 
 
No definite biliary dilatation. Normal gallbladder without stone. 
 
Normal function of both kidneys, no definite obstructive uropathy  . 
 
No definite enlargement of retroperitoneal LNs  . 
 
No abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen  . 
 
 
 
Impression:  
 
1.Liver cirrhosis 
 
2.S5 liver mass(3.16cm), favor HCC 
 
3.A 8.5mm early enhance nodule in S5 liver near surface, suspect HCC 
 
4.A 8.2mm hypodense or early washout nodule in S2-4 liver during  
 
portal and venous phase, suspect regenerative nodule or small HCC
